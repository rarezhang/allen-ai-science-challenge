Introduction 	  Is there a way to define life ? Scientifically, there is an actual definition of life. Living organisms must have certain characteristics. If they do not have these characteristics, are they living? This butterfly, like all other insects, animals, plants, and every other living organism, shares common characteristics with all life. What exactly does it mean to be alive? The Introduction to Biology chapter will answer this question. These lessons will serve as an introduction to biology, discussing basic Fundamental Concepts of Science and the Chemistry of Life. 
Introduction to  Biology 	  • Define the scientific method. • Explain the steps of the scientific method. • Describe how scientists study the natural world. • Develop a study incorporating the steps of the scientific method. Chances are you’ve heard of the scientific method. But what exactly is the scientific method? Is it a precise and exact way that all science must be done? Or is it a series of steps that most scientists generally follow, but may be modified for the benefit of an individual investigation? 
The  Scientific  Method 	  "We also discovered that science is cool and fun because you get to do stuff that no one has ever done before." In the article Blackawton bees, published by eight to ten year old students: Biology Letters (2010) URL publishing.org/content/early/2010/12/18/rsbl.2010.1056.abstract . There are basic methods of gaining knowledge that are common to all of science. At the heart of science is the scientific investigation, which is done by following the scientific method. A scientific investigation is a plan for asking questions and testing possible answers. It generally follows the steps listed in Figure 1.1. See URL outube.com/watch?v=KZaCy5Z87FA for an overview of the scientific method. Steps of a Scientific Investigation. 
 	  scientific investigation typically has these steps. Scientists often develop their own steps they follow in a scientific investigation. Shown here is a simplification of how a scientific investigation is done. 
Making  Observations 	  A scientific investigation typically begins with observations. You make observations all the time. Let’s say you take a walk in the woods and observe a moth, like the one in Figure 1.2, resting on a tree trunk. You notice that the moth has spots on its wings that look like eyes. You think the eye spots make the moth look like the face of an owl. 
Asking a  Question 	  Observations often lead to questions. For example, you might ask yourself why the moth has eye spots that make it look like an owl’s face. What reason might there be for this observation? 
Introduction to  Biology 	  Does this moth remind you of an owl? 
Forming a  Hypothesis 	  The next step in a scientific investigation is forming a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a possible answer to a scientific question, but it isn’t just any answer. A hypothesis must be based on scientific knowledge, and it must be logical. A hypothesis also must be falsifiable. In other words, it must be possible to make observations that would disprove the hypothesis if it really is false. Assume you know that some birds eat moths and that owls prey on other birds. From this knowledge, you reason that eye spots scare away birds that might eat the moth. This is your hypothesis. 
Testing the  Hypothesis 	  To test a hypothesis, you first need to make a prediction based on the hypothesis. A prediction is a statement that tells what will happen under certain conditions. It can be expressed in the form: If A occurs, then B will happen. Based on your hypothesis, you might make this prediction: If a moth has eye spots on its wings, then birds will avoid eating it. Next, you must gather evidence to test your prediction. Evidence is any type of data that may either agree or disagree with a prediction, so it may either support or disprove a hypothesis. Evidence may be gathered by an experiment. Assume that you gather evidence by making more observations of moths with eye spots. Perhaps you observe that birds really do avoid eating moths with eye spots. This evidence agrees with your prediction. 
Drawing  Conclusions 	  Evidence that agrees with your prediction supports your hypothesis. Does such evidence prove that your hypothesis is true? No; a hypothesis cannot be proven conclusively to be true. This is because you can never examine all of the possible evidence, and someday evidence might be found that disproves the hypothesis. Nonetheless, the more evidence that supports a hypothesis, the more likely the hypothesis is to be true. 
Communicating  Results 	  The last step in a scientific investigation is communicating what you have learned with others. This is a very important step because it allows others to test your hypothesis. If other researchers get the same results as yours, they add support to the hypothesis. However, if they get different results, they may disprove the hypothesis. When scientists share their results, they should describe their methods and point out any possible problems with the investigation. For example, while you were observing moths, perhaps your presence scared birds away. This introduces an error into your investigation. You got the results you predicted (the birds avoided the moths while you were observing them), but not for the reason you hypothesized. Other researchers might be able to think of ways to avoid this error in future studies.

Summary 	  • At the heart of science is the scientific investigation, which is done by following the scientific method. A scientific investigation is a plan for asking questions and testing possible answers. 
Introduction to  Biology 	  • A scientific investigation typically begins with observations. Observations often lead to questions. • A hypothesis is a possible logical answer to a scientific question, based on scientific knowledge. • A prediction is a statement that tells what will happen under certain conditions. • Evidence is any type of data that may either agree or disagree with a prediction, so it may either support or disprove a hypothesis.

So what exactly is an experiment? At first you may picture a science laboratory with microscopes and chemicals and people in white lab coats. But do all experiments have to be done in a lab? And do all scientists have to wear lab coats? 
Experiments 	  tion that is performed under controlled conditions, usually in a laboratory. Some experiments can be very simple, but even the simplest can contribute important evidence that helps scientists better understand the natural world. An example experiment can be seen here URL or here URL outube.com/watch?v=F10EyGwd57M . As many different types of experiments are possible, an experiment must be designed to produce data that can help confirm or reject the hypothesis. 
Medicine  From the  Ocean  Floor 	  Scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz are looking to perhaps the largest resource yet to be explored for its medical potential: the ocean. And they are taping this resource with some state-of-the-art technology. These scientists are using robots to sort through thousands of marine chemicals in search of cures for diseases like cholera, breast cancer, and malaria. These experiments are described in the following KQED links:

In this experiment, a scientist 	  is conducting research (and taking notes) while looking through a microscope. • URL • URL • URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Variables 	  An experiment generally tests how one variable is affected by another. The affected variable is called the dependent variable. In the plant experiment shown above, the dependent variable is plant growth. The variable that affects the dependent variable is called the independent variable. In the plant experiment, the independent variable could be fertilizer—some plants will get fertilizer, others will not. The scientists change the amount of the independent variable (the fertilizer) to observe the effects on the dependent variable (plant growth). An experiment needs to be run simultaneously in which no fertilizer is given to the plant. This would be known as a control experiment. In any experiment, other factors that might affect the dependent variable must be controlled. In the plant experiment, what factors do you think should be controlled? (Hint: What other factors might affect plant growth?) 
Sample  Size and  Repetition 	  The sample in an experiment or other investigation consists of the individuals or events that are studied, and the size of the sample (or sample size) directly affects the interpretation of the results. Typically, the sample is much smaller than all such individuals or events that exist in the world. Whether the results based on the sample are true in general cannot be known for certain. However, the larger the sample is, the more likely it is that the results are generally true. Similarly, the more times that an experiment is repeated (which is known as repetition) and the same results obtained, the more likely the results are valid. This is why scientific experiments should always be repeated. 
Bio- Inspiration:  Nature as  Muse 	  For hundreds of years, scientists have been using design ideas from structures in nature. Now, biologists and engineers at the University of California, Berkeley are working together to design a broad range of new products, such as life-saving milli-robots modeled on the way cockroaches run and adhesives based on the amazing design of a gecko’s foot. This process starts with making observations of nature, which lead to asking questions and to the additional aspects of the scientific process.

Introduction to  Biology 	  Microscopes are arguably one of the most important tools of the biologist. They allow the visualization of smaller and smaller biological organisms and molecules. With greatly magnified powers, these instruments are becoming increasingly important in modern day research.

She placed a few bacteria on gel A and a few on gel B. After 24 hours, she observed how many bacteria were present on each type of gel. 
Introduction to  Biology 	  • Define scientific theory. • Name several well-known theories in biology. Theory vs. theory. Is a scientific theory different from the everyday use of the word theory? A scientific theory is accepted as a scientific truth, supported by evidence collected by many scientists. The theory of evolution by natural selection is a classic scientific theory. 
Scientific  Theories 	  With repeated testing, some hypotheses may eventually become scientific theories. Keep in mind, a hypothesis is a possible answer to a scientific question. A scientific theory is a broad explanation for events that is widely accepted as true. To become a theory, a hypothesis must be tested over and over again, and it must be supported by a great deal of evidence. People commonly use the word theory to describe a guess about how or why something happens. For example, you might say, “I think a woodchuck dug this hole in the ground, but it’s just a theory.” Using the word theory in this way is different from the way it is used in science. A scientific theory is more like a fact than a guess because it is so well-supported. There are several well-known theories in biology, including the theory of evolution, cell theory, and germ theory. Two videos explaining scientific theories can be seen at URL and http ://URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. As you view Know the Difference (Between Hypothesis and Theory), focus on these concepts: 
The  Theory of  Evolution 	  The theory of evolution by natural selection is a scientific theory. Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. Evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. In natural selection, some living things produce more offspring than others, so they pass more genes to the next generation than others do. Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of living things. The theory of evolution by natural selection explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth. No evidence has been identified that proves this theory is incorrect. More on the theory of evolution will be presented in additional concepts. 
The  Cell  Theory 	  The cell theory is another important scientific theory of biology. According to the cell theory, the cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living organisms, all living organisms are made up of at least one cell, and living cells always come from other living cells. Once again, no evidence has been identified that proves this theory is incorrect. More on the cell theory will be presented in additional concepts. 
The  Germ  Theory 	  The germ theory of disease, also called the pathogenic theory of medicine, is a scientific theory that proposes that microorganisms are the cause of many diseases. Like the other scientific theories, lots of evidence has been identified that supports this theory, and no evidence has been identified that proves the theory is incorrect. 
Summary 	  • With repeated testing, some hypotheses may eventually become scientific theories. A scientific theory is a broad explanation for events that is widely accepted as true. • Evolution is a change species over time. Evolution occurs by natural selection. • The cell theory states that all living things are made up of cells, and living cells always come from other living cells. • The germ theory proposes that microorganisms are the cause of many diseases.

What do a bacterium and a whale have in common? Do they share characteristics with us? All living organisms, from the smallest bacterium to the largest whale, share certain characteristics of life. Without these characteristics, there is no life. 
Characteristics of  Life 	  Look at the duck decoy in Figure 1.5. It looks very similar to a real duck. Of course, real ducks are living things. What about the decoy duck? It looks like a duck, but it is actually made of wood. The decoy duck doesn’t have all the characteristics of a living thing. What characteristics set the real ducks apart from the decoy duck? What are the characteristics of living things? To be classified as a living thing, an object must have all six of the following characteristics: 
Response to the  Environment 	  All living things detect changes in their environment and respond to them. What happens if you step on a rock? Nothing; the rock doesn’t respond because it isn’t alive. But what if you think you are stepping on a rock and actually step on a turtle shell? The turtle is likely to respond by moving—it may even snap at you! 
Introduction to  Biology 	  This duck decoy looks like it’s alive. 
It 	  even fools real ducks. Why isn’t it a living thing? 
Growth and  Development 	  All living things grow and develop. For example, a plant seed may look like a lifeless pebble, but under the right conditions it will grow and develop into a plant. Animals also grow and develop. Look at the animals in Figure 1.6. How will the tadpoles change as they grow and develop into adult frogs? Tadpoles go through many changes to become adult frogs. 
Reproduction 	  All living things are capable of reproduction. Reproduction is the process by which living things give rise to offspring. Reproducing may be as simple as a single cell dividing to form two daughter cells. Generally, however, it is much more complicated. Nonetheless, whether a living thing is a huge whale or a microscopic bacterium, it is capable of reproduction. 
Keeping  Things  Constant 	  All living things are able to maintain a more-or-less constant internal environment. They keep things relatively stable on the inside regardless of the conditions around them. The process of maintaining a stable internal environment is called homeostasis. Human beings, for example, maintain a stable internal body temperature. If you go outside when the air temperature is below freezing, your body doesn’t freeze. Instead, by shivering and other means, it maintains a stable internal temperature. 
Complex  Chemistry 	  All living things—even the simplest life forms—have a complex chemistry. Living things consist of large, complex molecules, and they also undergo many complicated chemical changes to stay alive. Thousands (or more) of these chemical reactions occur in each cell at any given moment. Metabolism is the accumulated total of all the biochemical reactions occurring in a cell or organism. Complex chemistry is needed to carry out all the functions of life. 
Cells 	  All forms of life are built of at least one cell. A cell is the basic unit of the structure and function of living things. Living things may appear very different from one another on the outside, but their cells are very similar. Compare the human cells on the left in Figure 1.7 and onion cells on the right in Figure 1.7. How are they similar? If you click on the animation titled Inside a Cell at the link below, you can look inside a cell and see its internal structures. URL Human Cells (left). Onion Cells (right). If you looked at cells under a microscope, this is what you might see. 
Introduction to  Biology 	  • All living things detect changes in their environment and respond to them. • All living things grow and develop. • All living things are capable of reproduction, the process by which living things give rise to offspring. • All living things are able to maintain a constant internal environment through homeostasis. • All living things have complex chemistry. • All forms of life are built of cells. A cell is the basic unit of the structure and function of living things.

Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • URL → Non-Majors Biology → Search: Defining Biology could you determine if it is a living thing? • List the four unifying principles of biology. • Explain the four unifying principles of biology. • Discuss how and why these four principles unify biology. Reproduction, homeostasis, evolution, metabolism, heredity. What controls characteristics of life? Characteristics of life are controlled by genes, which are passed from parents to offspring, and are located on chromosomes, like the one shown here, that are found in every cell. The gene theory is one of the unifying principles of biology. 
Unifying  Principles of  Biology 	  Four unifying principles form the basis of biology. Whether biologists are interested in ancient life, the life of bacteria, or how humans could live on the moon, they base their overall understanding of biology on these four principles: 
The  Cell  Theory 	  According to the cell theory, all living things are made up of cells, which is the structural unit of living organisms, and living cells always come from other living cells. In fact, each living thing begins life as a single cell. Some living things, such as bacteria, remain single-celled. Other living things, including plants and animals, grow and develop into many cells. Your own body is made up of an amazing 100 trillion cells! But even you—like all other living things—began life as a single cell. 
Tiny diatoms and whale sharks are all 	  made of cells. Diatoms are about 20 µm in diameter and are made up of one cell, whereas whale sharks can measure up to billions of cells. 
The  Gene  Theory 	  The gene theory is the idea that the characteristics of living organisms are controlled by genes, which are passed from parents to their offspring. A gene is a segment of DNA that has the instructions to encode a protein. Genes are located on larger structures, called chromosomes, that are found inside every cell. Chromosomes, in turn, contain large molecules known as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Molecules of DNA are encoded with instructions that tell cells what to do. To see how this happens, click on the animation titled Journey into DNA at the following link: http ://URL . 
Homeostasis 	  Homeostasis, which is maintaining a stable internal environment or keeping things constant, is not just a characteristic of living things. It also applies to nature as a whole. Consider the concentration of oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere. Oxygen makes up 21% of the atmosphere, and this concentration is fairly constant. What keeps the concentration of oxygen constant? The answer is living things. Most living things need oxygen to survive, and when they breathe, they remove oxygen from the atmosphere. On the other hand, many living things, including plants, give off oxygen when they make food, and this adds oxygen to the atmosphere. The concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere is maintained mainly by the balance between these two processes. A quick overview of homeostasis can be viewed at URL . 
Evolution 	  Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. Evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. In natural selection, some living things produce more offspring than others, so they pass more genes to the next generation than others do. Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of living things. Evolution explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth. As living things evolve, they generally become better suited for their environment. This is because they evolve adaptations. An adaptation is a characteristic that helps a living thing survive and reproduce in a given environment. Look at the mole in Figure 1.9. It has tentacles around its nose that it uses to sense things by touch. The mole lives underground in the soil, where it is always dark. However, by using its touch organ, it can detect even tiny food items in the soil in total darkness. The touch organ is an adaptation because it helps the mole survive in its dark, underground environment. This mole uses its star-shaped nose organ to sense food by touch in the dark. 
The mole’s very large front claws are also 	  an adaptation for its life in the soil. Can you explain why? 
Summary 	  • The cell theory states that all living things are made up of cells, and living cells always come from other living cells. • The gene theory states that the characteristics of living things are controlled by genes. • Homeostasis is maintaining a constant internal environment. • Evolution is a change in species over time.

Introduction to  Biology 	  • Explain the meaning of interdependence. • Describe how living organisms interact. What other species do you need to survive? Species cannot live alone. All life needs other life to survive. Here surgeon fish are feeding on the algae growth on this turtle shell, a classic example of two species needing each other. This is an example of a symbiotic relationship. 
Interdependence of  Living  Things 	  All living things depend on their environment to supply them with what they need, including food, water, and shelter. Their environment consists of physical factors—such as soil, air, and temperature—and also of other organisms. An organism is an individual living thing. Many living things interact with other organisms in their environment. In fact, they may need other organisms in order to survive. This is known as interdependence. For example, living things that cannot make their own food must eat other organisms for food. Other interactions between living things include symbiosis and competition. 
Symbiosis 	  Symbiosis is a close relationship between organisms of different species in which at least one of the organisms benefits. The other organism may also benefit, it may be unaffected by the relationship, or it may be harmed by the relationship. Figure 1.10 shows an example of symbiosis. The birds in the picture are able to pick out food from the fur of the deer. The deer won’t eat the birds. In fact, the deer knowingly lets the birds rest on it. What, if anything, do you think the deer gets out of the relationship? 
A flock of starlings looks out, before 	  searching for parasites on a red deer stag. 
Competition 	  Competition is a relationship between living things that depend on the same resources. The resources may be food, water, or anything else they both need. Competition occurs whenever they both try to get the same resources in the same place and at the same time. The two organisms are likely to come into conflict, and the organism with better adaptations may win out over the other organism. 
Summary 	  • All living things depend on their environment to supply them with what they need, including food, water, and shelter. • Symbiosis is a close relationship between organisms of different species in which at least one of the organisms benefits. • Competition is a relationship between living things that depend on the same resources.

Introduction to  Biology 	  • Define cell. • Define biodiversity. • Describe the organization of organisms. • Summarize the levels of organization in an ecosystem. Organization of Living Things. What does this mean? We know it all starts with the cell. And for some species it ends with the cell. But for others, the cells come together to form tissues, tissues form organs, organs form organ systems, and organ systems combine to form an organism. 
Levels of  Organization 	  The living world can be organized into different levels. For example, many individual organisms can be organized into the following levels: • Cell: Basic unit of structure and function of all living things. • Tissue: Group of cells of the same kind. • Organ: Structure composed of one or more types of tissues. The tissues of an organ work together to perfume a specific function. Human organs include the brain, stomach, kidney, and liver. Plant organs include roots, stems, and leaves. • Organ system: Group of organs that work together to perform a certain function. Examples of organ systems in a human include the skeletal, nervous, and reproductive systems. • Organism: Individual living thing that may be made up of one or more organ systems. Examples of these levels of organization are shown in Figure 1.11. 
An individual mouse is made up of several 	  organ systems. The system shown here is the digestive system, which breaks down food into a form that cells can use. 
One of the organs of the digestive system 	  is the stomach. The stomach, in turn, consists of different types of tissues. Each type of tissue is made up of cells of the same type. There are also levels of organization above the individual organism. These levels are illustrated in Figure 1.12. • Organisms of the same species that live in the same area make up a population. For example, all of the goldfish living in the same area make up a goldfish population. • All of the populations that live in the same area make up a community. The community that includes the goldfish population also includes the populations of other fish, coral, and other organisms. • An ecosystem consists of all the living things ( biotic factors) in a given area, together with the nonliving environment ( abiotic factors). The nonliving environment includes water, sunlight, soil, and other physical factors. • A group of similar ecosystems with the same general type of physical environment is called a biome. • The biosphere is the part of Earth where all life exists, including all the land, water, and air where living things can be found. The biosphere consists of many different biomes. 
Diversity of  Life 	  Life on Earth is very diverse. The diversity of living things is called biodiversity. A measure of Earth’s biodiversity is the number of different species of organisms that live on Earth. At least 10 million different species live on Earth today. They are commonly grouped into six different kingdoms. Examples of organisms within each kingdom are shown in Figure 1.13. 
Summary 	  • Many individual organisms can be organized into the following levels: cells, tissues, organs, and organs systems. • An ecosystem consists of all the populations in a given area, together with the nonliving environment. • The biosphere is the part of Earth where all life exists. • The diversity of living things is called biodiversity.

Are dinosaurs evidence of past life forms? Evolution can be described as a change in species over time. Dinosaur fossils are significant evidence of evolution and of past life on Earth. 
Evolution of  Life 	  The diversity of life on Earth today is the result of evolution. Life began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since. At first, all living things on Earth were simple, single-celled organisms. Much later, the first multicellular organisms evolved, and after that, Earth’s biodiversity greatly increased. Figure 1.14 shows a timeline of the history of life on Earth. You can also find an interactive timeline of the history of life at the link below.

Darwin and the  Theory of  Evolution 	  The idea of evolution has been around for centuries. In fact, it goes all the way back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. However, evolution is most often associated with Charles Darwin. Darwin published a book on evolution in 1859 titled On the Origin of Species. In the book, Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection. He also presented a great deal of evidence that evolution occurs. Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. As described by Darwin, evolution occurs by a process called natural selection. In natural selection, some members of a species, being better adapted or suited to their environment, produce more offspring than others, so they pass "advantageous traits" to their offspring. Over many generations, this can lead to major changes in the characteristics of the species. Evolution explains how living things are changing today and how modern living things have descended from ancient life forms that no longer exist on Earth. As living things evolve, they generally become better suited for their environment. This is because they evolve adaptations. An adaptation is a trait that helps an organism survive and reproduce in a given environment. Despite all the evidence Darwin presented, his theory was not well-received at first. Many people found it hard to accept the idea that humans had evolved from an ape-like ancestor, and they saw evolution as a challenge to their religious beliefs. Look at the cartoon in Figure 1.15. Drawn in 1871, it depicts Darwin himself as an ape. The cartoon reflects how many people felt about Darwin and his theory during his own time. Darwin had actually expected this type of reaction to his theory and had waited a long time before publishing his book for this reason. It was only when another scientist, named Alfred Russel Wallace, developed essentially the same theory of evolution that Darwin put his book into print. Charles Darwin’s name is linked with the theory of evolution. This cartoon from the 1870s makes fun of both Darwin and his theory. Although Darwin presented a great deal of evidence for evolution in his book, he was unable to explain how evolution occurs. That’s because he knew nothing about genes. As a result, he didn’t know how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring, let alone how they could change over time. 
Evolutionary  Theory  After  Darwin 	  Since Darwin’s time, scientists have gathered even more evidence to support the theory of evolution. Some of the evidence comes from fossils, and some comes from studies that show how similar living things are to one another. By the 1930s, scientists had also learned about genes. As a result, they could finally explain how characteristics of organisms could pass from one generation to the next and change over time. Using modern technology, scientists can now directly compare the genes of living species. The more genes different species share in common, the more closely related the species are presumed to be. Consider humans and chimpanzees. They share about 98% of their genes. This means that they shared a common ancestor in the not-toodistant past. This is just one of many pieces of evidence that show we are part of the evolution of life on Earth. 
Misconceptions  About  Evolution 	  Today, evolution is still questioned by some people. Often, people who disagree with the theory of evolution do not really understand it. For example, some people think that the theory of evolution explains how life on Earth first began. In fact, the theory explains only how life changed after it first appeared. Some people think the theory of evolution means that humans evolved from modern apes. In fact, the theory suggests humans and modern apes have a common ancestor that lived several million years ago. These and other misconceptions about evolution contribute to the controversy that still surrounds this fundamental principle of biology. 
Summary 	  • Life began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since. • Darwin stated the theory of evolution by natural selection, presenting a great deal of evidence to support his theory. • Evolution is a change in the characteristics of living things over time. Evolution occurs by natural selection. • Characteristics of organisms are passed from one generation to the next through their genes.

Introduction to  Biology 	  • Explain why carbon is essential to life on Earth. • List the four major types of organic compounds. • Name the monomers of carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids. • Identify the main functions of the four types of organic compounds. Carbon. Element number six. Right in the middle of the first row of the Periodic Table. So what? Carbon is the most important element to life. Without this element, life as we know it would not exist. As you will see, carbon is the central element in compounds necessary for life. 
The  Significance of  Carbon 	  A compound found mainly in living things is known as an organic compound. Organic compounds make up the cells and other structures of organisms and carry out life processes. Carbon is the main element in organic compounds, so carbon is essential to life on Earth. Without carbon, life as we know it could not exist. 
Compounds 	  A compound is a substance that consists of two or more elements. A compound has a unique composition that is always the same. The smallest particle of a compound is called a molecule. Consider water as an example. A molecule of water always contains one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen. The composition of water is expressed by the chemical formula H2O. A model of a water molecule is shown in Figure 1.16. Water is not an organic compound. A water molecule always has this composition, one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen. What causes the atoms of a water molecule to “stick” together? The answer is chemical bonds. A chemical bond is a force that holds molecules together. Chemical bonds form when substances react with one another. A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical substances into others. A chemical reaction is needed to form a compound. Another chemical reaction is needed to separate the substances in a compound. 
Carbon 	  Why is carbon so basic to life? The reason is carbon’s ability to form stable bonds with many elements, including itself. This property allows carbon to form a huge variety of very large and complex molecules. In fact, there are nearly 10 million carbon-based compounds in living things! However, the millions of organic compounds can be grouped into just four major types: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. You can compare the four types in Table 1.1. Each type is also described below.

Introduction to  Biology 	  • Identify the chemical formula of glucose. • Describe the structure and function of monosaccharides. • List significant polysaccharides. • Identify the role of significant polysaccharides. Sugar. Does this look like biological energy? As a child, you may have been told that sugar is bad for you. Well, that’s not exactly true. Essentially, carbohydrates are made of sugar, from a single sugar molecule to thousands of sugar molecules attached together. Why? One reason is to store energy. But that does not mean you should eat it by the spoonful. 
Carbohydrates 	  Carbohydrates are the most common type of organic compound. A carbohydrate is an organic compound such as sugar or starch, and is used to store energy. Like most organic compounds, carbohydrates are built of small, repeating units that form bonds with each other to make a larger molecule. In the case of carbohydrates, the small repeating units are called monosaccharides. Carbohydrates contain only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. 
Monosaccharides and  Disaccharides 	  A monosaccharide is a simple sugar such as fructose or glucose. Fructose is found in fruits, whereas glucose generally results from the digestion of other carbohydrates. Glucose (C6H12O6) is used for energy by the cells of most organisms, and is a product of photosynthesis. The general formula for a monosaccharide is: (CH2O)n, where n can be any number greater than two. For example, in glucose n is 6, and the formula is: C6H12O6. Another monosaccharide, fructose, has the same chemical formula as glucose, but the atoms are arranged differently. Molecules with the same chemical formula but with atoms in a different arrangement are called isomers. Compare the glucose and fructose molecules in Figure 1.17. Can you identify their differences? The only differences are the positions of some of the atoms. These differences affect the properties of the two monosaccharides. 
Sucrose  Molecule.  This sucrose molecule 	  is a disaccharide. 
It is made up of two 	  monosaccharides: glucose on the left and fructose on the right. If two monosaccharides bond together, they form a carbohydrate called a disaccharide. An example of a disaccharide is sucrose (table sugar), which consists of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose ( Figure 1.17). Monosaccharides and disaccharides are also called simple sugars. They provide the major source of energy to living cells 
Polysaccharides 	  A polysaccharide is a complex carbohydrate that forms when simple sugars bind together in a chain. Polysaccharides may contain just a few simple sugars or thousands of them. Complex carbohydrates have two main functions: storing energy and forming structures of living things. Some examples of complex carbohydrates and their functions are shown in Table 1.2. Which type of complex carbohydrate does your own body use to store energy?

Biofuels:  From  Sugar to  Energy 	  For years there’s been buzz, both positive and negative, about generating ethanol fuel from corn. Is this a good idea? Is it necessary? These questions need to be discussed. However, the Bay Area of California is rapidly becoming a world center for the next generation of green fuel alternatives. The Joint BioEnergy Institute is developing methods to isolate biofuels from the sugars in cellulose. See Biofuels: Beyond Ethanol at URL sion/biofuels-beyond-ethanol for further information.

Introduction to  Biology 	  • Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. • List and describe the function of the main types of lipids. Oil. Does it mix with water? No. Biologically, why is this important? Oil is a lipid. The property of chemically not being able to mix with water gives lipids some very important biological functions. Lipids form the outer membrane of cells. Why? 
Lipids 	  A lipid is an organic compound such as fat or oil. Organisms use lipids to store energy, but lipids have other important roles as well. Lipids consist of repeating units called fatty acids. Fatty acids are organic compounds that have the general formula CH3(CH2)nCOOH, where n usually ranges from 2 to 28 and is always an even number. There are two types of fatty acids: saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids. 
Saturated  Fatty  Acids 	  In saturated fatty acids, carbon atoms are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. This causes the molecules to form straight chains, as shown in Figure 1.18. The straight chains can be packed together very tightly, allowing them to store energy in a compact form. This explains why saturated fatty acids are solids at room temperature. Animals use saturated fatty acids to store energy. 
Unsaturated  Fatty  Acids 	  In unsaturated fatty acids, some carbon atoms are not bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. Instead, they are bonded to other groups of atoms. Wherever carbon binds with these other groups of atoms, it causes chains 
Fatty  Acids.  Saturated fatty acids have 	  straight chains, like the three fatty acids shown in the upper left. Unsaturated fatty acids have bent chains, like all the other fatty acids in the figure. to bend (see Figure 1.18). The bent chains cannot be packed together very tightly, so unsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature. Plants use unsaturated fatty acids to store energy. Some examples are shown in Figure These plant products all contain unsaturated fatty acids. 
Types of  Lipids 	  Lipids may consist of fatty acids alone, or they may contain other molecules as well. For example, some lipids contain alcohol or phosphate groups. They include 
Lipids and  Diet 	  Humans need lipids for many vital functions, such as storing energy and forming cell membranes. Lipids can also supply cells with energy. In fact, a gram of lipids supplies more than twice as much energy as a gram of carbohydrates or proteins. Lipids are necessary in the diet for most of these functions. Although the human body can manufacture 
Triglyceride  Molecule.  The left part of this 	  triglyceride molecule represents glycerol. 
Each of the three long chains on the right 	  represents a different fatty acid. From top to bottom, the fatty acids are palmitic acid, oleic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid. The chemical formula for this triglyceride is C55H98O6. KEY:H=hydrogen, C=carbon, 
O=oxygen 	  most of the lipids it needs, there are others, called essential fatty acids, that must be consumed in food. Essential fatty acids include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Both of these fatty acids are needed for important biological processes, not just for energy. Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. 
Summary 	  • Organisms use lipids to store energy. There are two types of fatty acids: saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids. • Animals use saturated fatty acids to store energy. Plants use unsaturated fatty acids to store energy. • Phospholipids are the major components of cell membranes. • Excess dietary lipids can be harmful.

Introduction to  Biology 	  • Describe the composition of a protein. • Distinguish between the four levels of protein structure. • Summarize significant protein functions. You may have been told proteins are good for you. Do these look good to you? Proteins as food. To you, these may not look appetizing (or they might), but they do provide a nice supply of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Proteins have many important roles, from transporting, signaling, receiving, and catalyzing to storing, defending, and allowing for movement. Where do you get the amino acids needed so your cells can make their own proteins? If you cannot make it, you must eat it. 
Proteins 	  A protein is an organic compound made up of small molecules called amino acids. There are 20 different amino acids commonly found in the proteins of living organisms. Small proteins may contain just a few hundred amino acids, whereas large proteins may contain thousands of amino acids. The largest known proteins are titins, found in muscle, which are composed from over 27,000 amino acids. 
Protein  Structure 	  When amino acids bind together, they form a long chain called a polypeptide. A protein consists of one or more polypeptide chains. A protein may have up to four levels of structure. The lowest level, a protein’s primary structure, is its sequence of amino acids. Higher levels of protein structure are described in Figure 1.22. The complex structures of different proteins give them unique properties, which they need to carry out their various jobs in living organisms. You can learn more about protein structure by watching the animation at the following link: URL ww.stolaf.edu/people/giannini/flashanimat/proteins/protein%20structure.swf . 
General  Structure of  Amino  Acids.  This 	  model shows the general structure of all amino acids. Only the side chain, R, varies from one amino acid to another. For example, in the amino acid glycine, the side chain is simply hydrogen (H). In glutamic acid, in contrast, the side chain is 
H2 H2 H.  Variable side chains give 	  amino acids different chemical properties. 
The order of amino acids, together with 	  the properties of the amino acids, determines the shape of the protein, and the shape of the protein determines the function of the protein. KEY: H = hydrogen, N = nitrogen, C = carbon, O = oxygen, R = variable side chain Protein Structure. 
The structure of a 	  protein starts with its sequence of amino acids. What determines the secondary structure of a protein? What are two types of secondary protein structure? 
Functions of  Proteins 	  Proteins play many important roles in living things. Some proteins help cells keep their shape (structural proteins), some, such as connective and motor proteins, make up muscle tissues, and some transport items in and out of cells (transport proteins). Some proteins act as signals, and other proteins receive those signals. Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions in cells. Other proteins are antibodies, which bind to foreign substances such as bacteria and target them for destruction. Still other proteins carry messages or transport materials. For example, human red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin, which binds with oxygen. Hemoglobin allows the blood to carry oxygen from the lungs to cells throughout the body. A model of the hemoglobin molecule is shown in Figure 1.23.

Proteins and  Diet 	  Proteins in the diet are necessary for life. Dietary proteins are broken down into their component amino acids when food is digested. Cells can then use the components to build new proteins. Humans are able to synthesize all but eight of the twenty common amino acids. These eight amino acids, called essential amino acids, must be consumed in foods. Like dietary carbohydrates and lipids, dietary proteins can also be broken down to provide cells with energy. 
Summary 	  • Proteins are organic compounds made up of amino acids. • A protein may have up to four levels of structure. The complex structures of different proteins give them unique properties. • Enzymes are proteins that speed up biochemical reactions in cells.

Introduction to  Biology 	  • Describe the composition of a nucleic acid. • List the components of a nucleotide. • Identify significant differences between DNA and RNA. • Describe the shape of DNA. • Summarize significant roles of nucleic acids. You may have heard that something is "encoded in your DNA." What does that mean? Nucleic acids. Essentially the "instructions" or "blueprints" of life. Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is the unique blueprints to make the proteins that give you your traits. Half of these blueprints come from your mother, and half from your father. Therefore, every person that has ever lived except for identical twins has his or her own unique set of blueprints or instructions or DNA. 
Nucleic  Acids 	  A nucleic acid is an organic compound, such as DNA or RNA, that is built of small units called nucleotides. Many nucleotides bind together to form a chain called a polynucleotide. The nucleic acid DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) consists of two polynucleotide chains. The nucleic acid RNA (ribonucleic acid) consists of just one polynucleotide chain. An overview of DNA can be seen at URL (28:05). Click image to the left or use the URL below. As you view DNA, focus on the following concept: 
Structure of  Nucleic  Acids 	  Each nucleotide consists of three smaller molecules: If you look at Figure 1.24, you will see that the sugar of one nucleotide binds to the phosphate group of the next nucleotide. These two molecules alternate to form the backbone of the nucleotide chain. This backbone is known as the sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogen bases in a nucleic acid stick out from the backbone. There are four different types of bases: cytosine (C), adenine (A), guanine (G), and either thymine (T) in DNA, or uracil (U) in RNA. In DNA, bonds form between bases on the two nucleotide chains and hold the chains together. Each type of base binds with just one other type of base: cytosine always binds with guanine, and adenine always binds with thymine. These pairs of bases are called complementary base pairs. The binding of complementary bases allows DNA molecules to take their well-known shape, called a double helix, which is shown in Figure 1.25. A double helix is like a spiral staircase. The double helix shape forms naturally and is very strong, making the two polynucleotide chains difficult to break apart. An animation of DNA structure can be viewed at URL . 
Roles of  Nucleic  Acids 	  DNA is also known as the hereditary material or genetic information. It is found in genes, and its sequence of bases makes up a code. Between "starts" and "stops," the code carries instructions for the correct sequence of amino acids in a protein (see Figure 1.26). DNA and RNA have different functions relating to the genetic code and proteins. Like a set of blueprints, DNA contains the genetic instructions for the correct sequence of amino acids in proteins. RNA uses the information in DNA to assemble the correct amino acids and help make the protein. The information in DNA is passed from parent cells to daughter cells whenever cells divide. The information in DNA is also passed from parents to offspring when organisms reproduce. This is how inherited characteristics are passed from one generation to the next. 
Summary 	  • DNA and RNA are nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are built of small units called nucleotides. • The bases of DNA are adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine. In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil. • In DNA, A always binds to T, and G always binds to C. 
Introduction to  Biology 	  Nucleic Acid. 
Sugars and phosphate 	  groups form the backbone of a polynucleotide chain. Hydrogen bonds between complementary bases hold two polynucleotide chains together. DNA Molecule. Bonds between complementary bases help form the double helix of a DNA molecule. The letters A, T, G, and C stand for the bases adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The sequence of these four bases in DNA is a code that carries instructions for making proteins. Shown is how the DNA winds into a chromosome. The letters G, U, C, and A stand for the bases in RNA. Each group of three bases makes up a code word, and each code word represents one amino acid (represented here by a single letter, such as V, H, or L). A string of code words specifies the sequence of amino acids in a protein. • The shape of the DNA molecule is known as a double helix. • DNA contains the genetic instructions for the correct sequence of amino acids in proteins.

Introduction to  Biology 	  • Distinguish between a reactant and a product. • Describe what happens in chemical reactions. • Identify a chemical equation. Understanding chemistry is essential to fully understand biology. Why? A general understanding of chemistry is necessary to understand biology. Essentially, our cells are just thousands of chemicals —made of elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur —in just the right combinations. And these chemicals combine through chemical reactions. 
Chemical  Reactions 	  The element chlorine (Cl) is a greenish poison. Would you eat chlorine? Of course not, but you often eat a compound containing chlorine. In fact, you probably eat this chlorine compound just about every day. Do you know what it is? It’s table salt. Table salt is sodium chloride (NaCl), which forms when chlorine and sodium (Na) combine in certain proportions. How does chlorine, a toxic green chemical, change into harmless white table salt? It happens in a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical substances into others. A substance that starts a chemical reaction is called a reactant, and a substance that forms as a result of a chemical reaction is called a product. During a chemical reaction, the reactants are used up to create the products. An example of a chemical reaction is the burning of methane. In this chemical reaction, the reactants are methane (CH4) and oxygen (O2), and the products are carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). A chemical reaction involves the breaking and forming of chemical bonds. When methane burns, bonds break in the methane and oxygen molecules, and new bonds form in the molecules of carbon dioxide and water. 
Chemical  Equations 	  A chemical reaction can be represented by a chemical equation. For example, the burning of methane can be represented by the chemical equation 
H4 + 2 O2 →  O2 + 2 H2 	  The arrow in a chemical equation separates the reactants from the products and shows the direction in which the reaction proceeds. If the reaction could occur in the opposite direction as well, two arrows pointing in opposite directions would be used. The number 2 in front of O2 and H2O shows that two oxygen molecules and two water molecules are involved in the reaction. (With no number in front of a chemical symbol, just one molecule is involved.) 
Conservation of  Matter 	  In a chemical reaction, the quantity of each element does not change; there is the same amount of each element in the products as there was in the reactants. This is because matter is always conserved. The conservation of matter is reflected in a reaction’s chemical equation. The same number of atoms of each element appears on each side of the arrow. For example, in the chemical equation above, there are four hydrogen atoms on each side of the arrow. Can you find all four of them on each side of the equation? 
Summary 	  • A chemical reaction is a process that changes some chemical substances into others. During a chemical reaction, the reactants are used up to create the products. • In a chemical reaction, matter is always conserved.

Introduction to  Biology 	  • Define energy. • Distinguish between an exothermic reaction and an endothermic reaction. • Describe the role of energy in chemical reactions. • Explain the significance of activation energy. What is energy? Where does your energy come from? Can energy be recycled? This team of ants is breaking down a dead tree. A classic example of teamwork. And all that work takes energy. In fact, each chemical reaction the chemical reactions that allow the cells in those ants to do the work needs energy to get started. And all that energy comes from the food the ants eat. Whatever eats the ants gets their energy from the ants. Energy passes through an ecosystem in one direction only. 
Chemical  Reactions and  Energy 	  Chemical reactions always involve energy. Energy is a property of matter that is defined as the ability to do work. When methane burns, for example, it releases energy in the form of heat and light. Other chemical reactions absorb energy rather than release it. 
Exothermic  Reactions 	  A chemical reaction that releases energy (as heat) is called an exothermic reaction. This type of reaction can be represented by a general chemical equation: 
Reactants →  Products +  Heat 	  In addition to methane burning, another example of an exothermic reaction is chlorine combining with sodium to form table salt. This reaction also releases energy. 
Endothermic  Reaction 	  A chemical reaction that absorbs energy is called an endothermic reaction. This type of reaction can also be represented by a general chemical equation: 
Reactants +  Heat →  Products 	  Did you ever use a chemical cold pack? The pack cools down because of an endothermic reaction. When a tube inside the pack is broken, it releases a chemical that reacts with water inside the pack. This reaction absorbs heat energy and quickly cools down the pack. 
Activation  Energy 	  All chemical reactions need energy to get started. Even reactions that release energy need a boost of energy in order to begin. The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy. Activation energy is like the push a child needs to start going down a playground slide. The push gives the child enough energy to start moving, but once she starts, she keeps moving without being pushed again. Activation energy is illustrated in Figure 1.27. Activation Energy. Activation energy provides the “push” needed to start a chemical reaction. 
Is the chemical reaction in 	  this figure an exothermic or endothermic reaction? Why do all chemical reactions need energy to get started? In order for reactions to begin, reactant molecules must bump into each other, so they must be moving, and movement requires energy. When reactant molecules bump together, they may repel each other because of intermolecular forces pushing them apart. Overcoming these forces so the molecules can come together and react also takes energy.

Summary 	  • Chemical reactions always involve energy. A chemical reaction that releases energy is an exothermic reaction, and a chemical reaction that absorbs energy is an endothermic reaction. The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is the activation energy. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • URL → Non-Majors Biology → Search: Energy • Describe what happens in biochemical reactions. • Distinguish between catabolic and anabolic reactions. What do you get when you cross biology and chemistry? Hummingbirds, with their tiny bodies and high levels of activity, have the highest metabolic rates of any animals —roughly a dozen times that of a pigeon and a hundred times that of an elephant. The metabolic rate, or rate of metabolism, has to do with the amount of energy the organism uses. And that energy is used to drive the chemical reactions in cells —or the biochemical reactions. And, of course, it is all the biochemical reactions that allow the cells function properly, and maintain life. 
Biochemical  Reactions 	  Biochemical reactions are chemical reactions that take place inside the cells of living things. The field of biochemistry demonstrates that knowledge of chemistry as well as biology is needed to understand fully the life processes of organisms at the level of the cell. The sum of all the biochemical reactions in an organism is called metabolism. It includes both exothermic and endothermic reactions. 
Types of  Biochemical  Reactions 	  Exothermic reactions in organisms are called catabolic reactions. These reactions break down molecules into smaller units and release energy. An example of a catabolic reaction is the breakdown of glucose, which releases energy that cells need to carry out life processes. Endothermic reactions in organisms are called anabolic reactions. These reactions build up bigger molecules from smaller ones. An example of an anabolic reaction is the joining of amino acids to form a protein. Which type of reactions—catabolic or anabolic—do you think occur when your body digests food?

Laboratory at http://www.wikihow.com/ Contrast- Biochemical- Reactions- Inside-the- Body-and- Chemical- 	  eactions-in--the-Chemistry-Laboratory . • Define enzyme. • Summarize the importance of enzymes to living organisms. What is a biological catalyst? This super fast train can obviously reach great speeds. And there’s a lot of technology that helps this train go fast. Speaking of helping things go fast brings us to enzymes. Life could not exist without enzymes. Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions. 
Enzymes and  Biochemical  Reactions 	  Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes. Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts. Like other catalysts, enzymes are not reactants in the reactions they control. They help the reactants interact but are not used up in the reactions. Instead, they may be used over and over again. Unlike other catalysts, enzymes are usually highly specific for particular chemical reactions. They generally catalyze only one or a few types of reactions. Enzymes are extremely efficient in speeding up reactions. They can catalyze up to several million reactions per second. As a result, the difference in rates of biochemical reactions with and without enzymes may be enormous. 
Introduction to  Biology 	  A typical biochemical reaction might take hours or even days to occur under normal cellular conditions without an enzyme, but less than a second with an enzyme. Enzymes, an overview of these proteins, can be viewed at URL (9:43). Click image to the left or use the URL below. As you view Enzymes, focus on these concepts: 
Importance of  Enzymes 	  Enzymes are involved in most of the biochemical reactions that take place in organisms. About 4,000 such reactions are known to be catalyzed by enzymes, but the number may be even higher. Enzymes allow reactions to occur at the rate necessary for life. In animals, an important function of enzymes is to help digest food. Digestive enzymes speed up reactions that break down large molecules of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into smaller molecules the body can use. Without digestive enzymes, animals would not be able to break down food molecules quickly enough to provide the energy and nutrients they need to survive. 
Summary 	  • Enzymes are biological catalysts. They speed up biochemical reactions. • Enzymes are involved in most of the chemical reactions that take place in organisms. Use this resources to answer the questions that follow. • How Cells Work: Enzymes at URL . there? 
Introduction to  Biology 	  • Summarize the importance of enzymes to living organisms. • Define substrate and active site. • Describe how enzymes function. • Differentiate between a biochemical reaction in the presence or absence of an enzyme. • Describe the effects of temperature and pH on enzyme activity. Do cells have one enzyme with lots of functions, or many enzymes, each with just one function? Enzymes. Magical proteins necessary for life. So how do enzymes work? How do they catalyze just one specific biochemical reaction? In a puzzle, only two pieces will fit together properly. Understanding that is one of the main steps in understanding how enzymes work. 
Enzyme  Function 	  How do enzymes speed up biochemical reactions so dramatically? Like all catalysts, enzymes work by lowering the activation energy of chemical reactions. Activation energy is the energy needed to start a chemical reaction. This is illustrated in Figure 1.28. The biochemical reaction shown in the figure requires about three times as much activation energy without the enzyme as it does with the enzyme. An animation of how enzymes work can be seen at URL (2:02). Click image to the left or use the URL below. As you view Enzyme Animation, focus on this concept: 
The reaction represented by this graph 	  is a combustion reaction involving the reactants glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). The products of the reaction are carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). Energy is also released during the reaction. The enzyme speeds up the reaction by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to start. Compare the activation energy with and without the enzyme. Enzymes generally lower activation energy by reducing the energy needed for reactants to come together and react. For example: • Enzymes bring reactants together so they don’t have to expend energy moving about until they collide at random. Enzymes bind both reactant molecules (called the substrate), tightly and specifically, at a site on the enzyme molecule called the active site ( Figure 1.29). • By binding reactants at the active site, enzymes also position reactants correctly, so they do not have to overcome intermolecular forces that would otherwise push them apart. This allows the molecules to interact with less energy. • Enzymes may also allow reactions to occur by different pathways that have lower activation energy. The active site is specific for the reactants of the biochemical reaction the enzyme catalyzes. Similar to puzzle pieces fitting together, the active site can only bind certain substrates. The activities of enzymes also depend on the temperature, ionic conditions, and the pH of the surroundings. Some enzymes work best at acidic pHs, while others work best in neutral environments. • Digestive enzymes secreted in the acidic environment (low pH) of the stomach help break down proteins into smaller molecules. The main digestive enzyme in the stomach is pepsin, which works best at a pH of about 
This enzyme molecule binds reactant 	  molecules—called substrate—at its active site, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. This brings the reactants together and positions them correctly so the reaction can occur. After the reaction, the products are released from the enzyme’s active site. This frees up the enzyme so it can catalyze additional reactions. system, which breaks protein chains in food into smaller parts. Trypsin works in the small intestine, which is not an acidic environment. Trypsin’s optimum pH is about 8. • Biochemical reactions are optimal at physiological temperatures. For example, most biochemical reactions work best at the normal body temperature of 98.6˚F. Many enzymes lose function at lower and higher temperatures. At higher temperatures, an enzyme’s shape deteriorates. Only when the temperature comes back to normal does the enzyme regain its shape and normal activity.

Introduction to  Biology 	  • Describe the distribution of Earth’s water. • Explain a polar molecule. • Describe the significance of hydrogen bonds. • Identify water’s structure and properties. • Explain why water is essential for life. Dihydrogen oxide or dihydrogen monoxide. Does this chemical sound dangerous? Another name for this compound is. . . water. Water can create some absolutely beautiful sights. Iguassu Falls is the largest series of waterfalls on the planet, located in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. And water is necessary for life. The importance of water to life cannot be emphasized enough. All life needs water. Life started in water. Essentially, without this simple three atom molecule, life would not exist. 
Water 	  Water, like carbon, has a special role in living things. It is needed by all known forms of life. Water is a simple molecule, containing just three atoms. Nonetheless, water’s structure gives it unique properties that help explain why it is vital to all living organisms. 
Water,  Water  Everywhere 	  Water is a common chemical substance on planet Earth. In fact, Earth is sometimes called the "water planet" because almost 75% of its surface is covered with water. If you look at Figure 1.30, you will see where Earth’s water is found. The term water generally refers to its liquid state, and water is a liquid over a wide range of temperatures on Earth. However, water also occurs on Earth as a solid (ice) and as a gas (water vapor). 
Most of the water on  Earth consists of 	  saltwater in the oceans. What percent of 
Earth’s water is fresh water?  Where is 	  most of the fresh water found? 
Structure and  Properties of  Water 	  No doubt, you are already aware of some of the properties of water. For example, you probably know that water is tasteless and odorless. You also probably know that water is transparent, which means that light can pass through it. This is important for organisms that live in the water, because some of them need sunlight to make food. 
Chemical  Structure of  Water 	  To understand some of water’s properties, you need to know more about its chemical structure. As you have seen, each molecule of water consists of one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen. The oxygen atom in a water molecule attracts negatively-charged electrons more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do. As a result, the oxygen atom has a slightly negative charge, and the hydrogen atoms have a slightly positive charge. A difference in electrical charge between different parts of the same molecule is called polarity, making water a polar molecule. The diagram in Figure 1.31 shows water’s polarity. Opposites attract when it comes to charged molecules. In the case of water, the positive (hydrogen) end of one water molecule is attracted to the negative (oxygen) end of a nearby water molecule. Because of this attraction, weak bonds form between adjacent water molecules, as shown in Figure 1.32. The type of bond that forms between molecules is called a hydrogen bond. Bonds between molecules are not as strong as bonds within molecules. There are just many more hydrogen bonds in water (between water molecules) than there are covalent bonds within a molecule. The hydrogen bonds may not be strong, but in water they are strong enough to hold together nearby molecules. 
Properties of  Water 	  Hydrogen bonds between water molecules explain some of water’s properties. For example, hydrogen bonds explain why water molecules tend to stick together. Have you ever watched water drip from a leaky faucet or from a melting icicle? If you have, then you know that water always falls in drops rather than as separate molecules. The dew drops in Figure 1.33 are another example of water molecules sticking together. Hydrogen bonds cause water to have a relatively high boiling point of 100°C (212°F). Because of its high boiling 
Water  Molecule.  This diagram shows the 	  positive and negative parts of a water molecule. It also depicts how a charge, such as on an ion (Na or Cl, for example) can interact with a water molecule. Hydrogen Bonding in Water Molecules. 
Hydrogen bonds form between nearby 	  water molecules. How do you think this might affect water’s properties? 
Droplets of  Dew.  Drops of dew cling to a 	  spider web in this picture. Can you think of other examples of water forming drops? (Hint: What happens when rain falls on a newly waxed car?) point, most water on Earth is in a liquid state rather than in a gaseous state. Water in its liquid state is needed by all living things. Hydrogen bonds also cause water to expand when it freezes. This, in turn, causes ice to have a lower density (mass/volume) than liquid water. The lower density of ice means that it floats on water. For example, in cold climates, ice floats on top of the water in lakes. This allows lake animals such as fish to survive the winter by staying in the water under the ice. 
Water and  Life 	  The human body is about 70% water (not counting the water in body fat, which varies from person to person). The body needs all this water to function normally. Just why is so much water required by human beings and other organisms? Water can dissolve many substances that organisms need, and it is necessary for many biochemical reactions. The examples below are among the most important biochemical processes that occur in living things, but they are just two of many ways that water is involved in biochemical reactions. • Photosynthesis—In this process, cells use the energy in sunlight to change carbon dioxide and water to glucose and oxygen. Water is a reactant in this process. The reactions of photosynthesis can be represented by the chemical equation • Cellular respiration—In this process, cells break down glucose in the presence of oxygen and release carbon dioxide, water (a product), and energy. The reactions of cellular respiration can be represented by the chemical equation C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy. Water is involved in many other biochemical reactions. As a result, just about all life processes depend on water. Clearly, life as we know it could not exist without water. 
Summary 	  • Water is needed by all known forms of life. 
Introduction to  Biology 	  • Due to the difference in the distribution of charge, water is a polar molecule. • Hydrogen bonds hold adjacent water molecules together. • Water is involved in many biochemical reactions. As a result, just about all life processes depend on water. Use these resources to answer the questions that follow. • Water at URL . • URL → Non-Majors Biology → Search: Properties of Water • Define solution. • Explain an ion. • Define acids, bases, and pH. • Describe the relationship between acidity and pH. • Discuss the importance of acids and bases in living organisms. Acids and bases. Why are these important in biology? It comes back to a number of biological processes. For example, enzymes work best at specific levels of acids or bases. Take your stomach, a very acidic environment. The enzymes that work in that environment could not work in your mouth. What would your food taste like if your mouth was also a very acidic environment? 
Acids and  Bases 	  Water is the main ingredient of many solutions. A solution is a mixture of two or more substances that has the same composition throughout. Some solutions are acids and some are bases. To understand acids and bases, you need to know more about pure water. In pure water (such as distilled water), a tiny fraction of water molecules naturally breaks down to form ions. An ion is an electrically charged atom or molecule. The breakdown of water is represented by the chemical equation The products of this reaction are a hydronium ion (H3O+) and a hydroxide ion (OH−). The hydroxide ion, which has a negative charge, forms when a water molecule gives up a positively charged hydrogen ion (H+). The hydronium ion, which has positive charge, forms when another water molecule accepts the hydrogen ion. 
Introduction to  Biology 	  The concentration of hydronium ions in a solution is known as acidity. In pure water, the concentration of hydronium ions is very low; only about 1 in 10 million water molecules naturally breaks down to form a hydronium ion. As a result, pure water is essentially neutral. Acidity is measured on a scale called pH, as shown in Figure 1.34. Pure water has a pH of 7, so the point of neutrality on the pH scale is 7. 
Acidity and the p H  Scale  Water has a 	  pH of 7, so this is the point of neutrality on the pH scale. Acids have a pH less than 7, and bases have a pH greater than 7. Approximate pHs of examples are shown. 
Acids 	  If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid. As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass. 
Bases 	  If a solution has a lower concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH higher than 7. A solution with a pH higher than 7 is called a base. Bases, such as baking soda, have a bitter taste. Like strong acids, strong bases can harm organisms and damage materials. For example, lye can burn the skin, and bleach can remove the color from clothing. 
Acids and  Bases in  Organisms 	  Acids and bases are important in living things because most enzymes can do their job only at a certain level of acidity. Cells secrete acids and bases to maintain the proper pH for enzymes to work. For example, every time you digest food, acids and bases are at work in your digestive system. Consider the acidic environment of the stomach. The acidic environment helps with the digestion of food. The enzyme pepsin, which helps break down proteins in the stomach can only function optimally in the low pH environment. The stomach secretes a strong acid that allows pepsin to work, and the stomach to do its job. However, when stomach contents enter the small intestine, the acid must be neutralized. This is because enzymes in the small intestine need a basic environment in order to work. An organ called the pancreas secretes a strong base into the small intestine, and this base neutralizes the acid.

Summary 	  The scientific method is the process by which biological information, like that of all other sciences, has been identified. This has resulted in a number of important biological scientific theories, including the cell theory and the theory of evolution. All life is built around carbon, and four categories of organic compounds: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. One particular type of protein, enzymes, are biological catalysts, allowing biochemical reactions to proceed at the rate necessary to maintain life. One other molecule, water, is also essential to life, though water is not an organic compound. ristics of a living thing . CC BY 2.0 elopment, a characteristic of life .

Introduction 	  What is a cell? It could easily be said that a cell is the fundamental unit of life, the smallest unit capable of life or the structural and functional unit necessary for life. But whatever it is, a cell is necessary for life. The Cell Biology chapter will discuss some of the fundamental properties of the cell, with lessons that include the cell structure, transport in and out of the cell, energy metabolism, and cell division and reproduction. • Describe the importance of the work of Hooke and van Leeuwenhoek. • Summarize the cell theory. • Identify the parts that all are common to all cells. What’s the same between a bacterial cell and one of your cells? There are many different types of cells, but they all have certain parts in common. As this image of human blood shows, cells come in different shapes and sizes. The shapes and sizes directly influence the function of the cell. Yet, all cells cells from the smallest bacteria to those in the largest whale do some similar functions, so they do have parts in common. 
Discovery of  Cells 	  The first time the word cell was used to refer to these tiny units of life was in 1665 by a British scientist named Robert Hooke. Hooke was one of the earliest scientists to study living things under a microscope. The microscopes of his day were not very strong, but Hooke was still able to make an important discovery. When he looked at a thin slice of cork under his microscope, he was surprised to see what looked like a honeycomb. Hooke made the drawing in Figure 2.1 to show what he saw. As you can see, the cork was made up of many tiny units, which Hooke called cells. Soon after Robert Hooke discovered cells in cork, Anton van Leeuwenhoek in Holland made other important discoveries using a microscope. Leeuwenhoek made his own microscope lenses, and he was so good at it that Cork Cells. This is what Robert Hooke saw when he looked at a thin slice of cork under his microscope. What type of material is cork? Do you know where cork comes from? his microscope was more powerful than other microscopes of his day. In fact, Leeuwenhoek’s microscope was almost as strong as modern light microscopes. Using his microscope, Leeuwenhoek discovered tiny animals such as rotifers. Leeuwenhoek also discovered human blood cells. He even scraped plaque from his own teeth and observed it under the microscope. What do you think Leeuwenhoek saw in the plaque? He saw tiny living things with a single cell that he named animalcules (“tiny animals”). Today, we call Leeuwenhoek’s animalcules bacteria. 
The  Cell  Theory 	  The Cell Theory is one of the fundamental theories of biology. For two centuries after the discovery of the microscope by Robert Hooke and Anton van Leeuwenhoek, biologists found cells everywhere. Biologists in the early part of the 19th century suggested that all living things were made of cells, but the role of cells as the primary building block of life was not discovered until 1839 when two German scientists, Theodor Schwann, a zoologist (studies animals), and Matthias Jakob Schleiden, a botanist (studies plants), suggested that cells were the basic unit of structure and function of all life. Later, in 1858, the German doctor Rudolf Virchow observed that cells divide to produce more cells. He proposed that all cells arise only from other cells. The collective observations of all three scientists form the Cell Theory, which states that: • all organisms are made up of one or more cells, • all the life functions of an organism occur within cells, • all cells come from preexisting cells. 
Cell  Diversity 	  Cells with different functions often have different shapes. The cells pictured in Figure 2.2 are just a few examples of the many different shapes that cells may have. Each type of cell in the figure has a shape that helps it do its job. For example, the job of the nerve cell is to carry messages to other cells. The nerve cell has many long extensions that reach out in all directions, allowing it to pass messages to many other cells at once. Do you see the tail-like projections on the algae cells? Algae live in water, and their tails help them swim. Pollen grains have spikes that help them stick to insects such as bees. How do you think the spikes help the pollen grains do their job? (Hint: Insects pollinate flowers.) 
Four  Common  Parts of a  Cell 	  Although cells are diverse, all cells have certain parts in common. The parts include a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA. As these pictures show, cells come in many different shapes. How are the shapes of these cells related to their functions? the physical boundary between the cell and its environment, so you can think of it as the ”skin” of the cell. plasm is made up of a watery substance called cytosol, and contains other cell structures such as ribosomes. These parts are common to all cells, from organisms as different as bacteria and human beings. How did all known organisms come to have such similar cells? The similarities show that all life on Earth has a common evolutionary history. A nice introduction to the cell is available at URL (21:03). Click image to the left or use the URL below.

For example, in you there are blood cells and skin cells and bone cells and even bacteria. Here we have drawings of bacteria and human cells. Can you tell which depicts various types of bacteria? However, all cells whether from bacteria, human, or any other organism will be one of two general types. In fact, all cells other than bacteria will be one type, and bacterial cells will be the other. And it all depends on how the cell stores its DNA. 
Two  Types of  Cells 	  There is another basic cell structure that is present in many but not all living cells: the nucleus. The nucleus of a cell is a structure in the cytoplasm that is surrounded by a membrane (the nuclear membrane) and contains, and protects, most of the cell’s DNA. Based on whether they have a nucleus, there are two basic types of cells: prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. You can watch animations of both types of cells at the link below. URL m/animation/animation.php?ani=162&cat=biology 
Prokaryotic  Cells 	  Prokaryotic cells are cells without a nucleus. The DNA in prokaryotic cells is in the cytoplasm rather than enclosed within a nuclear membrane. Prokaryotic cells are found in single-celled organisms, such as bacteria, like the one shown in Figure 2.3. Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes. They were the first type of organisms to evolve and are still the most common organisms today. Bacteria are described in the following video URL (18:26).

Prokaryotic  Cell.  This diagram shows the 	  structure of a typical prokaryotic cell, a bacterium. Like other prokaryotic cells, this bacterial cell lacks a nucleus but has other cell parts, including a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and DNA. Identify each of these parts in the diagram. 
Eukaryotic  Cells 	  Eukaryotic cells are cells that contain a nucleus. A typical eukaryotic cell is shown in Figure 2.4. Eukaryotic cells are usually larger than prokaryotic cells, and they are found mainly in multicellular organisms. Organisms with eukaryotic cells are called eukaryotes, and they range from fungi to people. Eukaryotic cells also contain other organelles besides the nucleus. An organelle is a structure within the cytoplasm that performs a specific job in the cell. Organelles called mitochondria, for example, provide energy to the cell, and organelles called vacuoles store substances in the cell. Organelles allow eukaryotic cells to carry out more functions than prokaryotic cells can. This allows eukaryotic cells to have greater cell specificity than prokaryotic cells. Ribosomes, the organelle where proteins are made, are the only organelles in prokaryotic cells. In some ways, a cell resembles a plastic bag full of Jell-O. Its basic structure is a plasma membrane filled with cytoplasm. Like Jell-O containing mixed fruit, the cytoplasm of the cell also contains various structures, such as a nucleus and other organelles.

Summary 	  • Prokaryotic cells are cells without a nucleus. • Eukaryotic cells are cells that contain a nucleus. • Eukaryotic cells have other organelles besides the nucleus. The only organelles in a prokaryotic cell are ribosomes.

Is it even a living organism? This alien-looking thing is a virus. But is it prokaryotic or eukaryotic? Or neither? Or both? A virus is essentially genetic material surrounded by protein. That’s it. So, is a virus prokaryotic or eukaryotic? Or neither? Or both? Viruses: Prokaryotes or Eukaryotes? Viruses, like the one depicted in Figure 2.5, are tiny particles that may cause disease. Human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold and flu. Do you think viruses are prokaryotes or eukaryotes? The answer may surprise you. Viruses are not cells at all, so they are neither prokaryotes nor eukaryotes. Viruses contain DNA but not much else. They lack the other parts shared by all cells, including a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes. Therefore, viruses are not cells, but are they alive? All living things not only have cells; they are also capable of reproduction. Viruses cannot reproduce by themselves. Instead, they infect living hosts, and use the hosts’ cells to make copies of their own DNA. Viruses also do not have their own metabolism or maintain homeostasis. For these reasons, most scientists do not consider viruses to be living things. An overview of viruses can be seen at URL (23:17). Click image to the left or use the URL below.

All cells have a plasma membrane. This membrane surrounds the cell. So what is its role? Can molecules enter and leave the cell? Yes. Can anything or everything enter or leave? No. So, what determines what can go in or out? Is it the nucleus? The DNA? Or the plasma membrane? 
The  Plasma  Membrane 	  The plasma membrane (also known as the cell membrane) forms a barrier between the cytoplasm inside the cell and the environment outside the cell. It protects and supports the cell and also controls everything that enters and leaves the cell. It allows only certain substances to pass through, while keeping others in or out. The ability to allow only certain molecules in or out of the cell is referred to as selective permeability or semipermeability. To understand how the plasma membrane controls what crosses into or out of the cell, you need to know its composition. The plasma membrane is discussed at URL (6:16). 
A  Phospholipid  Bilayer 	  The plasma membrane is composed mainly of phospholipids, which consist of fatty acids and alcohol. The phospholipids in the plasma membrane are arranged in two layers, called a phospholipid bilayer. As shown in Figure water ( hydrophobic). The water-hating tails are on the interior of the membrane, whereas the water-loving heads point outwards, toward either the cytoplasm or the fluid that surrounds the cell. Molecules that are hydrophobic can easily pass through the plasma membrane, if they are small enough, because they are water-hating like the interior of the membrane. Molecules that are hydrophilic, on the other hand, cannot pass through the plasma membrane—at least not without help—because they are water-loving like the exterior of the membrane, and are therefore excluded from the interior of the membrane. Phospholipid Bilayer. The phospholipid bilayer consists of two layers of phospholipids, with a hydrophobic, or water-hating, interior and a hydrophilic, or water-loving, exterior. The hydrophilic (polar) head group and hydrophobic tails (fatty acid chains) are depicted in the single phospholipid molecule. The polar head group and fatty acid chains are attached by a 3-carbon glycerol unit.

Can anything or everything move in or out of the cell? No. It is the semipermeable plasma membrane that determines what can enter and leave the cell. So, if not everything can cross the membrane, how do certain things get across? 
Membrane  Proteins 	  The plasma membrane contains molecules other than phospholipids, primarily other lipids and proteins. The green molecules in Figure 2.7, for example, are the lipid cholesterol. Molecules of cholesterol help the plasma membrane keep its shape. Many of the proteins in the plasma membrane assist other substances in crossing the membrane. The plasma membranes also contain certain types of proteins. A membrane protein is a protein molecule that is attached to, or associated with, the membrane of a cell or an organelle. Membrane proteins can be put into two groups based on how the protein is associated with the membrane. Integral membrane proteins are permanently embedded within the plasma membrane. They have a range of important functions. Such functions include channeling or transporting molecules across the membrane. Other integral proteins act as cell receptors. Integral membrane proteins can be classified according to their relationship with the bilayer: • Transmembrane proteins span the entire plasma membrane. Transmembrane proteins are found in all types of biological membranes. • Integral monotopic proteins are permanently attached to the membrane from only one side. Some integral membrane proteins are responsible for cell adhesion (sticking of a cell to another cell or surface). On the outside of cell membranes and attached to some of the proteins are carbohydrate chains that act as labels that identify the cell type. Shown in Figure 2.7 are two different types of membrane proteins and associated molecules. Peripheral membrane proteins are proteins that are only temporarily associated with the membrane. They can be easily removed, which allows them to be involved in cell signaling. Peripheral proteins can also be attached to integral membrane proteins, or they can stick into a small portion of the lipid bilayer by themselves. Peripheral membrane proteins are often associated with ion channels and transmembrane receptors. Most peripheral membrane proteins are hydrophilic. Some of the membrane proteins make up a major transport system that moves molecules and ions through the polar phospholipid bilayer. 
The  Fluid  Mosaic  Model 	  In 1972 S.J. Singer and G.L. Nicolson proposed the now widely accepted Fluid Mosaic Model of the structure of cell membranes. The model proposes that integral membrane proteins are embedded in the phospholipid bilayer, as seen in Figure 2.7. Some of these proteins extend all the way through the bilayer, and some only partially across it. These membrane proteins act as transport proteins and receptors proteins. Their model also proposed that the membrane behaves like a fluid, rather than a solid. The proteins and lipids of the membrane move around the membrane, much like buoys in water. Such movement causes a constant change in the "mosaic pattern" of the plasma membrane. A further description of the Fluid Mosaic Model can be viewed at URL (1:27).

Extensions of the  Plasma  Membrane 	  The plasma membrane may have extensions, such as whip-like flagella or brush-like cilia. In single-celled organisms, like those shown in Figure 2.8, the membrane extensions may help the organisms move. In multicellular organisms, the extensions have other functions. For example, the cilia on human lung cells sweep foreign particles and mucus toward the mouth and nose. Flagella and Cilia. Cilia and flagella are extensions of the plasma membrane of many cells.

Does a cell have, or even need, a "skeleton"? What do you get if you take some tubing, and make the tubes smaller and smaller and smaller? You get very small tubes, or microtubes. Very small tubes, or microtubules, together with microfilaments, form the basis of the "skeleton" inside the cell. 
The  Cytoplasm and  Cytoskeleton 	  The cytoplasm consists of everything inside the plasma membrane of the cell, excluding the nucleus in a eukaryotic cell. It includes the watery, gel-like material called cytosol, as well as various structures. The water in the cytoplasm makes up about two thirds of the cell’s weight and gives the cell many of its properties. 
Functions of the  Cytoplasm 	  The cytoplasm has several important functions, including: 
The  Cytoskeleton 	  The cytoskeleton is a cellular "scaffolding" or "skeleton" that crisscrosses the cytoplasm. All eukaryotic cells have a cytoskeleton, and recent research has shown that prokaryotic cells also have a cytoskeleton. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is made up of a network of long, thin protein fibers and has many functions. 
It helps to maintain 	  cell shape. It holds organelles in place, and for some cells, it enables cell movement. The cytoskeleton also plays important roles in both the intracellular movement of substances and in cell division. Certain proteins act like a path that vesicles and organelles move along within the cell. The threadlike proteins that make up the cytoskeleton continually rebuild to adapt to the cell’s constantly changing needs. Three main kinds of cytoskeleton fibers are microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments. • Microtubules, shown in Figure 2.9 (a), are hollow cylinders and are the thickest of the cytoskeleton structures. They are most commonly made of filaments which are polymers of alpha and beta tubulin, and radiate outwards from an area near the nucleus called the centrosome. Tubulin is the protein that forms microtubules. Two forms of tubulin, alpha and beta, form dimers (pairs) which come together to form the hollow cylinders. The cylinders are twisted around each other to form the microtubules. Microtubules help the cell keep its shape. They hold organelles in place and allow them to move around the cell, and they form the mitotic spindle during cell division. Microtubules also make up parts of cilia and flagella, the organelles that help a cell move. • Microfilaments, shown in Figure 2.9 (b), are made of two thin actin chains that are twisted around one another. Microfilaments are mostly concentrated just beneath the cell membrane, where they support the cell and help the cell keep its shape. Microfilaments form cytoplasmatic extensions, such as pseudopodia and microvilli, which allow certain cells to move. The actin of the microfilaments interacts with the protein myosin to cause contraction in muscle cells. Microfilaments are found in almost every cell, and are numerous in muscle cells and in cells that move by changing shape, such as phagocytes (white blood cells that search the body for bacteria and other invaders). • Intermediate filaments differ in make-up from one cell type to another. Intermediate filaments organize the inside structure of the cell by holding organelles and providing strength. They are also structural components of the nuclear envelope. Intermediate filaments made of the protein keratin are found in skin, hair, and nails cells.

Summary 	  • The cytoplasm consists of everything inside the plasma membrane of the cell. • The cytoskeleton is a cellular "skeleton" that crisscrosses the cytoplasm. Three main cytoskeleton fibers are microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments. • Microtubules are the thickest of the cytoskeleton structures and are most commonly made of filaments which are polymers of alpha and beta tubulin. • Microfilament are the thinnest of the cytoskeleton structures and are made of two thin actin chains that are twisted around one another.

Where does the DNA live? The answer depends on if the cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic. The main difference between the two types of cells is the presence of a nucleus. And in eukaryotic cells, DNA lives in the nucleus. 
The  Nucleus 	  The nucleus is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in most eukaryotic cells. The nucleus is the largest organelle in the cell and contains most of the cell’s genetic information (mitochondria also contain DNA, called mitochondrial DNA, but it makes up just a small percentage of the cell’s overall DNA content). The genetic information, which contains the information for the structure and function of the organism, is found encoded in DNA in the form of genes. A gene is a short segment of DNA that contains information to encode an RNA molecule or a protein strand. DNA in the nucleus is organized in long linear strands that are attached to different proteins. These proteins help the DNA coil up for better storage in the nucleus. Think how a string gets tightly coiled up if you twist one end while holding the other end. These long strands of coiled-up DNA and proteins are called chromosomes. Each chromosome contains many genes. The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression. Gene expression is the process by which the information in a gene is "decoded" by various cell molecules to produce a functional gene product, such as a protein molecule or an RNA molecule. The degree of DNA coiling determines whether the chromosome strands are short and thick or long and thin. Between cell divisions, the DNA in chromosomes is more loosely coiled and forms long, thin strands called chromatin. Before the cell divides, the chromatin coil up more tightly and form chromosomes. Only chromosomes stain clearly enough to be seen under a microscope. The word chromosome comes from the Greek word chroma (color), and soma (body), due to its ability to be stained strongly by dyes. 
The  Nuclear  Envelope 	  The nuclear envelope is a double membrane of the nucleus that encloses the genetic material. 
It separates the 	  and an outer membrane. The outer membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Many tiny holes called nuclear pores are found in the nuclear envelope. These nuclear pores help to regulate the exchange of materials (such as RNA and proteins) between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. 
The  Nucleolus 	  The nucleus of many cells also contains a non-membrane bound organelle called a nucleolus, shown in Figure 2.10. The nucleolus is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. Ribosomes are organelles made of protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and they build cellular proteins in the cytoplasm. The function of the rRNA is to provide a way of decoding the genetic messages within another type of RNA (called mRNA), into amino acids. After being made in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm, where they direct protein synthesis. 
The eukaryotic cell nucleus.  Visible in this 	  diagram are the ribosome-studded double membranes of the nuclear envelope, the DNA (as chromatin), and the nucleolus. 
Within the cell nucleus is a viscous liquid 	  called nucleoplasm, similar to the cytoplasm found outside the nucleus. The chromatin (which is normally invisible), is visible in this figure only to show that it is spread throughout the nucleus. 
Summary 	  • The nucleus is a membrane-enclosed organelle, found in most eukaryotic cells, which stores the genetic material (DNA). • The nucleus is surrounded by a double lipid bilayer, the nuclear envelope, which is embedded with nuclear pores. • The nucleolus is inside the nucleus, and is where ribosomes are made. Use this resource to answer the following questions. • The Cell Nucleus at URL . • Explain the structure and function of the ribosome. • Summarize the structure and function of mitochondria. Sperm cells and muscle cells need lots of energy. What do they have in common? They have lots of mitochondria. Mitochondria are called the power plants of the cell, as these organelles are where most of the cell’s energy is produced. Cells that need lots of energy have lots of mitochondria. 
Other  Organelles 	  In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells have many other organelles, including ribosomes and mitochondria. Ribosomes are present in all cells. 
Ribosomes 	  Ribosomes are small organelles and are the sites of protein synthesis (or assembly). They are made of ribosomal protein and ribosomal RNA, and are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Unlike other organelles, ribosomes are not surrounded by a membrane. Each ribosome has two parts, a large and a small subunit, as shown in Figure 2.11. The subunits are attached to one another. Ribosomes can be found alone or in groups within the cytoplasm. Some ribosomes are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (as shown in Figure 2.12), and others are attached to the nuclear envelope. Ribozymes are RNA molecules that catalyze chemical reactions, such as translation. Translation is the process of ordering the amino acids in the assembly of a protein, and translation will be discussed more in another concept. The two subunits that make up a ribosome, small organelles that are intercellular protein factories. Briefly, the ribosomes interact with other RNA molecules to make chains of amino acids called polypeptide chains, due to the peptide bond that forms between individual amino acids. Polypeptide chains are built from the genetic instructions held within a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. Polypeptide chains that are made on the rough ER (discussed below) are inserted directly into the ER and then are transported to their various cellular destinations. Ribosomes on the rough ER usually produce proteins that are destined for the cell membrane. Ribosomes are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Ribosomes are not surrounded by a membrane. The other organelles found in eukaryotic cells are surrounded by a membrane. 
Mitochondria 	  A mitochondrion ( mitochondria, plural), is a membrane-enclosed organelle that is found in most eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria are called the "power plants" of the cell because they are the sites of cellular respiration, where they use energy from organic compounds to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP is the cell’s energy source that is used for such things such as movement and cell division. Some ATP is made in the cytosol of the cell, but most of it is made inside mitochondria. The number of mitochondria in a cell depends on the cell’s energy needs. For example, active human muscle cells may have thousands of mitochondria, while less active red blood cells do not have any. As Figure 2.12 (a) and (b) show, a mitochondrion has two phospholipid membranes. The smooth outer membrane separates the mitochondrion from the cytosol. The inner membrane has many folds, called cristae. The fluid-filled inside of the mitochondrion, called matrix, is where most of the cell’s ATP is made. Although most of a cell’s DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, mitochondria have their own DNA. Mitochondria are able to reproduce asexually, and scientists think that they are descended from prokaryotes. According to the endosymbiotic theory, mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotes that infected or were engulfed by ancient eukaryotic cells. The invading prokaryotes were protected inside the eukaryotic host cell, and in turn the prokaryote supplied extra ATP to its host. 
Summary 	  • Ribosomes are small organelles and are the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes are found in all cells. • Mitochondria are where energy from organic compounds is used to make ATP. (a): Electron micrograph of a single mitochondrion, within which you can see many cristae. Mitochondria range from 1 to 10 µm in size.

Does a cell have its own ER? Yes, but in this case, the ER is not just for emergencies. True, there might be times when the cell responds to emergency conditions and the functions of the ER may be needed, but usually the cell’s ER is involved in normal functions. Proteins are also made on the outside of the ER, and this starts a whole process of protein transport, both around the inside of the cell and to the cell membrane and out. 
Other  Organelles 	  In addition to the nucleus, eukaryotic cells have many other organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles, vacuoles, and centrioles. 
Endoplasmic  Reticulum 	  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (plural, reticuli) is a network of phospholipid membranes that form hollow tubes, flattened sheets, and round sacs. These flattened, hollow folds and sacs are called cisternae. The ER has two major functions: • Transport: Molecules, such as proteins, can move from place to place inside the ER, much like on an intracellular highway. • Synthesis: Ribosomes that are attached to ER, similar to unattached ribosomes, make proteins. Lipids are also produced in the ER. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). • Rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes, which gives it a "rough" appearance. These ribosomes make proteins that are then transported from the ER in small sacs called transport vesicles. The transport vesicles pinch off the ends of the ER. The rough endoplasmic reticulum works with the Golgi apparatus to move new proteins to their proper destinations in the cell. The membrane of the RER is continuous with the outer layer of the nuclear envelope. • Smooth endoplasmic reticulum does not have any ribosomes attached to it, and so it has a smooth appearance. SER has many different functions, some of which include lipid synthesis, calcium ion storage, and drug detoxification. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in both animal and plant cells and it serves different functions in each. The SER is made up of tubules and vesicles that branch out to form a network. In some cells there are dilated areas like the sacs of RER. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum and RER form an interconnected network. 
Image of nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum 	  and Golgi apparatus, and how they work together. The process of secretion from endoplasmic reticuli to Golgi apparatus is shown. 
Golgi  Apparatus 	  The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that is usually made up of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered discs called cisternae, as shown in Figure 2.13. The cisternae look a bit like a stack of deflated balloons. The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell. The Golgi apparatus is found close to the nucleus of the cell, where it modifies proteins that have been delivered in transport vesicles from the RER. It is also involved in the transport of lipids around the cell. Pieces of the Golgi membrane pinch off to form vesicles that transport molecules around the cell. The Golgi apparatus can be thought of as similar to a post office; it packages and labels "items" and then sends them to different parts of the cell. Both plant and animal cells have a Golgi apparatus. Plant cells can have up to several hundred Golgi stacks scattered throughout the cytoplasm. In plants, the Golgi apparatus contains enzymes that synthesize some of the cell wall polysaccharides. 
Vesicles 	  A vesicle is a small, spherical compartment that is separated from the cytosol by at least one lipid bilayer. Many vesicles are made in the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, or are made from parts of the cell membrane. Vesicles from the Golgi apparatus can be seen in Figure 2.13. Because it is separated from the cytosol, the space inside the vesicle can be made to be chemically different from the cytosol. Vesicles are basic tools of the cell for organizing metabolism, transport, and storage of molecules. Vesicles are also used as chemical reaction chambers. They can be classified by their contents and function. • Transport vesicles are able to move molecules between locations inside the cell. For example, transport vesicles move proteins from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. • Lysosomes are vesicles that are formed by the Golgi apparatus. They contain powerful enzymes that could break down (digest) the cell. Lysosomes break down harmful cell products, waste materials, and cellular debris and then force them out of the cell. They also digest invading organisms such as bacteria. Lysosomes also break down cells that are ready to die, a process called autolysis. • Peroxisomes are vesicles that use oxygen to break down toxic substances in the cell. Unlike lysosomes, which are formed by the Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes self-replicate by growing bigger and then dividing. They are common in liver and kidney cells that break down harmful substances. Peroxisomes are named for the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that is produced when they break down organic compounds. Hydrogen peroxide is toxic, and in turn is broken down into water (H2O) and oxygen (O2) molecules. 
Vacuoles 	  Vacuoles are membrane-bound organelles that can have secretory, excretory, and storage functions. Many organisms will use vacuoles as storage areas and some plant cells have very large vacuoles. Vesicles are much smaller than vacuoles and function in transporting materials both within and to the outside of the cell. 
Centrioles 	  Centrioles are rod-like structures made of short microtubules. Nine groups of three microtubules make up each centriole. Two perpendicular centrioles make up the centrosome. Centrioles are very important in cellular division, where they arrange the mitotic spindles that pull the chromosome apart during mitosis. 
Summary 	  • The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in the synthesis of lipids and synthesis and transport of proteins. • The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell. • Vesicles are also used as chemical reaction chambers. Transport vesicles, lysosomes, and peroxisomes are types of vesicles. • Vacuoles have secretory, excretory, and storage functions. • Centrioles are made of short microtubules and are very important in cell division.

What do plants have to do that animals don’t? Many plant cells are green. Why? Plant cells also usually have a distinct shape. The rigid exterior around the cells is necessary to allow the plants to grow upright. Animal cells do not have these rigid exteriors. There are other distinct differences between plant and animal cells. These will be the focus of this concept. 
Special  Structures in  Plant  Cells 	  Most organelles are common to both animal and plant cells. However, plant cells also have features that animal cells do not have: a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids such as chloroplasts. Plants have very different lifestyles from animals, and these differences are apparent when you examine the structure of the plant cell. Plants make their own food in a process called photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) and convert them into sugars. The features unique to plant cells can be seen in Figure 2.14. In addition to containing most of the organelles found in animal cells, plant cells also have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids. These three features are not found in animal cells. 
The  Cell  Wall 	  A cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell. The cell wall contains not only cellulose and protein, but other polysaccharides as well. The cell wall provides structural support and protection. Pores in the cell wall allow water and nutrients to move into and out of the cell. The cell wall also prevents the plant cell from bursting when water enters the cell. Microtubules guide the formation of the plant cell wall. Cellulose is laid down by enzymes to form the primary cell wall. Some plants also have a secondary cell wall. The secondary wall contains a lignin, a secondary cell component in plant cells that have completed cell growth/expansion. 
The  Central  Vacuole 	  Most mature plant cells have a central vacuole that occupies more than 30% of the cell’s volume. The central vacuole can occupy as much as 90% of the volume of certain cells. The central vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast. The central vacuole has many functions. Aside from storage, the main role of the vacuole is to maintain turgor pressure against the cell wall. Proteins found in the tonoplast control the flow of water into and out of the vacuole. The central vacuole also stores the pigments that color flowers. The central vacuole contains large amounts of a liquid called cell sap, which differs in composition to the cell cytosol. Cell sap is a mixture of water, enzymes, ions, salts, and other substances. Cell sap may also contain toxic byproducts that have been removed from the cytosol. Toxins in the vacuole may help to protect some plants from being eaten. 
Plastids 	  Plant plastids are a group of closely related membrane-bound organelles that carry out many functions. They are responsible for photosynthesis, for storage of products such as starch, and for the synthesis of many types of molecules that are needed as cellular building blocks. Plastids have the ability to change their function between these and other forms. Plastids contain their own DNA and some ribosomes, and scientists think that plastids are descended from photosynthetic bacteria that allowed the first eukaryotes to make oxygen. The main types of plastids and their functions are: • Chloroplasts are the organelle of photosynthesis. They capture light energy from the sun and use it with water and carbon dioxide to make food (sugar) for the plant. The arrangement of chloroplasts in a plant’s cells can be seen in Figure 2.15. • Chromoplasts make and store pigments that give petals and fruit their orange and yellow colors. • Leucoplasts do not contain pigments and are located in roots and non-photosynthetic tissues of plants. They may become specialized for bulk storage of starch, lipid, or protein. However, in many cells, leucoplasts do not have a major storage function. Instead, they make molecules such as fatty acids and many amino acids. Plant cells with visible chloroplasts. 
Chloroplasts 	  Chloroplasts capture light energy from the sun and use it with water and carbon dioxide to produce sugars for food. Chloroplasts look like flat discs and are usually 2 to 10 micrometers in diameter and 1 micrometer thick. A model of a chloroplast is shown in Figure 2.16. The chloroplast is enclosed by an inner and an outer phospholipid membrane. Between these two layers is the intermembrane space. The fluid within the chloroplast is called the stroma, and it contains one or more molecules of small, circular DNA. The stroma also has ribosomes. Within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids, sub-organelles that are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids are arranged in stacks called grana (singular: granum). A thylakoid has a flattened disk shape. Inside it is an empty area called the thylakoid space or lumen. Photosynthesis takes place on the thylakoid membrane. Within the thylakoid membrane is the complex of proteins and light-absorbing pigments, such as chlorophyll and carotenoids. This complex allows capture of light energy from many wavelengths because chlorophyll and carotenoids both absorb different wavelengths of light. These will be further discussed in the "Photosynthesis" concept. The internal structure of a chloroplast, with a granal stack of thylakoids circled. 
Summary 	  • Plant cells have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and plastids such as chloroplasts. • The cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell, providing structural support and protection. • The central vacuole maintains turgor pressure against the cell wall. • Chloroplasts capture light energy from the sun and use it with water and carbon dioxide to produce sugars for food.

Why be organized? It can be said organization leads to efficiency. And in you, cells are organized into tissues, which are organized into organs, which are organized into organ systems, which form you. And it can be said that the human body is a very organized and efficient system. 
Organization of  Cells 	  Biological organization exists at all levels in organisms. It can be seen at the smallest level, in the molecules that made up such things as DNA and proteins, to the largest level, in an organism such as a blue whale, the largest mammal on Earth. Similarly, single celled prokaryotes and eukaryotes show order in the way their cells are arranged. Single-celled organisms such as an amoeba are free-floating and independent-living. Their single-celled "bodies" are able to carry out all the processes of life, such as metabolism and respiration, without help from other cells. Some single-celled organisms, such as bacteria, can group together and form a biofilm. A biofilm is a large grouping of many bacteria that sticks to a surface and makes a protective coating over itself. Biofilms can show similarities to multicellular organisms. Division of labor is the process in which one group of cells does one job (such as making the "glue" that sticks the biofilm to the surface), while another group of cells does another job (such as taking in nutrients). Multicellular organisms carry out their life processes through division of labor. They have specialized cells that do specific jobs. However, biofilms are not considered multicellular organisms and are instead called colonial organisms. The difference between a multicellular organism and a colonial organism is that individual organisms from a colony or biofilm can, if separated, survive on their own, while cells from a multicellular organism (e.g., liver cells) cannot. Colonial algae of the genus Volvox. 
Colonial  Organisms 	  Colonial organisms were probably one of the first evolutionary steps towards multicellular organisms. Algae of the genus Volvox are an example of the border between colonial organisms and multicellular organisms. Each Volvox, shown in Figure 2.17, is a colonial organism. It is made up of between 1,000 to 3,000 photosynthetic algae that are grouped together into a hollow sphere. The sphere has a distinct front and back end. The cells have eyespots, which are more developed in the cells near the front. This enables the colony to swim towards light. 
Origin of  Multicellularity 	  The oldest known multicellular organism is a red algae Bangiomorpha pubescens, fossils of which were found in organisms. Scientists think that multicellularity arose from cooperation between many organisms of the same species. The Colonial Theory proposes that this cooperation led to the development of a multicellular organism. Many examples of cooperation between organisms in nature have been observed. For example, a certain species of amoeba (a singlecelled protist) groups together during times of food shortage and forms a colony that moves as one to a new location. Some of these amoebas then become slightly differentiated from each other. Volvox, shown in Figure 2.17, is another example of a colonial organism. Most scientists accept that the Colonial Theory explains how multicellular organisms evolved. Multicellular organisms are organisms that are made up of more than one type of cell and have specialized cells that are grouped together to carry out specialized functions. Most life that you can see without a microscope is multicellular. As discussed earlier, the cells of a multicellular organism would not survive as independent cells. The body of a multicellular organism, such as a tree or a cat, exhibits organization at several levels: tissues, organs, and organ systems. Similar cells are grouped into tissues, groups of tissues make up organs, and organs with a similar function are grouped into an organ system. 
Levels of  Organization in  Multicellular  Organisms 	  The simplest living multicellular organisms, sponges, are made of many specialized types of cells that work together for a common goal. Such cell types include digestive cells, tubular pore cells, and epidermal cells. Though the different cell types create a large, organized, multicellular structure —the visible sponge —they are not organized into true interconnected tissues. If a sponge is broken up by passing it through a sieve, the sponge will reform on the other side. However, if the sponge’s cells are separated from each other, the individual cell types cannot survive alone. Simpler colonial organisms, such as members of the genus Volvox, as shown in Figure 2.17, differ in that their individual cells are free-living and can survive on their own if separated from the colony. 
This roundworm, a multicellular organism, was stained to highlight the 	  nuclei of all the cells in its body (red dots). A tissue is a group of connected cells that have a similar function within an organism. More complex organisms such as jellyfish, coral, and sea anemones have a tissue level of organization. For example, jellyfish have tissues that have separate protective, digestive, and sensory functions. Even more complex organisms, such as the roundworm shown in Figure 2.18, while also having differentiated cells and tissues, have an organ level of development. An organ is a group of tissues that has a specific function or group of functions. Organs can be as primitive as the brain of a flatworm (a group of nerve cells), as large as the stem of a sequoia (up to 90 meters, or 300 feet, in height), or as complex as a human liver. The most complex organisms (such as mammals, trees, and flowers) have organ systems. An organ system is a group of organs that act together to carry out complex related functions, with each organ focusing on a part of the task. An example is the human digestive system, in which the mouth ingests food, the stomach crushes and liquifies it, the pancreas and gall bladder make and release digestive enzymes, and the intestines absorb nutrients into the blood.

They have specialized cells that do specific jobs. • The Colonial Theory proposes that cooperation among cells of the same species led to the development of a multicellular organism. • Multicellular organisms, depending on their complexity, may be organized from cells to tissues, organs, and organ systems.

What will eventually happen to these dyes? They will all blend together. The dyes will move through the water until an even distribution is achieved. The process of moving from areas of high amounts to areas of low amounts is called diffusion. 
Passive  Transport 	  Probably the most important feature of a cell’s phospholipid membranes is that they are selectively permeable or semipermeable. A membrane that is selectively permeable has control over what molecules or ions can enter or leave the cell, as shown in Figure 2.19. The permeability of a membrane is dependent on the organization and characteristics of the membrane lipids and proteins. In this way, cell membranes help maintain a state of homeostasis within cells (and tissues, organs, and organ systems) so that an organism can stay alive and healthy. A selectively permeable membrane allows certain molecules through, but not others. 
Transport  Across  Membranes 	  The molecular make-up of the phospholipid bilayer limits the types of molecules that can pass through it. For example, hydrophobic (water-hating) molecules, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2), can easily pass through the lipid bilayer, but ions such as calcium (Ca2+) and polar molecules such as water (H2O) cannot. The hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer does not allow ions or polar molecules through because these molecules are hydrophilic, or water loving. In addition, large molecules such as sugars and proteins are too big to pass through the bilayer. Transport proteins within the membrane allow these molecules to pass through the membrane, and into or out of the cell. This way, polar molecules avoid contact with the nonpolar interior of the membrane, and large molecules are moved through large pores. Every cell is contained within a membrane punctuated with transport proteins that act as channels or pumps to let in or force out certain molecules. The purpose of the transport proteins is to protect the cell’s internal environment and to keep its balance of salts, nutrients, and proteins within a range that keeps the cell and the organism alive. There are three main ways that molecules can pass through a phospholipid membrane. The first way requires no energy input by the cell and is called passive transport. The second way requires that the cell uses energy to pull in or pump out certain molecules and ions and is called active transport. The third way is through vesicle transport, in which large molecules are moved across the membrane in bubble-like sacks that are made from pieces of the membrane. Passive transport is a way that small molecules or ions move across the cell membrane without input of energy by the cell. The three main kinds of passive transport are diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated diffusion. 
Diffusion 	  Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration of the molecules to an area with a lower concentration. The difference in the concentrations of the molecules in the two areas is called the concentration gradient. Diffusion will continue until this gradient has been eliminated. Since diffusion moves materials from an area of higher concentration to the lower, it is described as moving solutes "down the concentration gradient." The end result of diffusion is an equal concentration, or equilibrium, of molecules on both sides of the membrane. If a molecule can pass freely through a cell membrane, it will cross the membrane by diffusion ( Figure 2.20). 
Molecules move from an area of high 	  concentration to an area of lower concentration until an equilibrium is met. The molecules continue to cross the membrane at equilibrium, but at equal rates in both directions. 
Summary 	  • The cell membrane is selectively permeable, allowing only certain substances to pass through. • Passive transport is a way that small molecules or ions move across the cell membrane without input of energy by the cell.

Saltwater Fish vs. Freshwater Fish? Fish cells, like all cells, have semi-permeable membranes. Eventually, the concentration of "stuff" on either side of them will even out. A fish that lives in salt water will have somewhat salty water inside itself. Put it in the freshwater, and the freshwater will, through osmosis, enter the fish, causing its cells to swell, and the fish will die. What will happen to a freshwater fish in the ocean? 
Osmosis 	  Imagine you have a cup that has 100ml water, and you add 15g of table sugar to the water. The sugar dissolves and the mixture that is now in the cup is made up of a solute (the sugar) that is dissolved in the solvent (the water). The mixture of a solute in a solvent is called a solution. Imagine now that you have a second cup with 100ml of water, and you add 45 grams of table sugar to the water. Just like the first cup, the sugar is the solute, and the water is the solvent. But now you have two mixtures of different solute concentrations. In comparing two solutions of unequal solute concentration, the solution with the higher solute concentration is hypertonic, and the solution with the lower solute concentration is hypotonic. Solutions of equal solute concentration are isotonic. The first sugar solution is hypotonic to the second solution. The second sugar solution is hypertonic to the first. You now add the two solutions to a beaker that has been divided by a selectively permeable membrane, with pores that are too small for the sugar molecules to pass through, but are big enough for the water molecules to pass through. The hypertonic solution is on one side of the membrane and the hypotonic solution on the other. The hypertonic solution has a lower water concentration than the hypotonic solution, so a concentration gradient of water now exists across the membrane. Water molecules will move from the side of higher water concentration to the side of lower concentration until both solutions are isotonic. At this point, equilibrium is reached. Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Water moves into and out of cells by osmosis. If a cell is in a hypertonic solution, the solution has a lower water concentration than the cell cytosol, and water moves out of the cell until both solutions are isotonic. Cells placed in a hypotonic solution will take in water across their membrane until both the external solution and the cytosol are isotonic. A cell that does not have a rigid cell wall, such as a red blood cell, will swell and lyse (burst) when placed in a hypotonic solution. Cells with a cell wall will swell when placed in a hypotonic solution, but once the cell is turgid (firm), the tough cell wall prevents any more water from entering the cell. When placed in a hypertonic solution, a cell without a cell wall will lose water to the environment, shrivel, and probably die. In a hypertonic solution, a cell with a cell wall will lose water too. The plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall as it shrivels, a process called plasmolysis. Animal cells tend to do best in an isotonic environment, plant cells tend to do best in a hypotonic environment. This is demonstrated in Figure 2.21. it will 
Unless an animal cell (such as the red 	  blood cell in the top panel) has an adaptation that allows it to alter the osmotic uptake of water, lose too much water and shrivel up in a hypertonic environment. If placed in a hypotonic solution, water molecules will enter the cell, causing it to swell and burst. Plant cells (bottom panel) become plasmolyzed in a hypertonic solution, but tend to do best in a hypotonic environment. Water is stored in the central vacuole of the plant cell. 
Osmotic  Pressure 	  When water moves into a cell by osmosis, osmotic pressure may build up inside the cell. If a cell has a cell wall, the wall helps maintain the cell’s water balance. Osmotic pressure is the main cause of support in many plants. When a plant cell is in a hypotonic environment, the osmotic entry of water raises the turgor pressure exerted against the cell wall until the pressure prevents more water from coming into the cell. At this point the plant cell is turgid ( Figure 
The central vacuoles of the plant cells in 	  this image are full of water, so the cells are turgid. The action of osmosis can be very harmful to organisms, especially ones without cell walls. For example, if a saltwater fish (whose cells are isotonic with seawater), is placed in fresh water, its cells will take on excess water, lyse, and the fish will die. Another example of a harmful osmotic effect is the use of table salt to kill slugs and snails. Diffusion and osmosis are discussed at URL (18:59). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Controlling  Osmosis 	  Organisms that live in a hypotonic environment such as freshwater, need a way to prevent their cells from taking in too much water by osmosis. A contractile vacuole is a type of vacuole that removes excess water from a cell. Freshwater protists, such as the paramecium shown in Figure 2.23, have a contractile vacuole. The vacuole is surrounded by several canals, which absorb water by osmosis from the cytoplasm. After the canals fill with water, the water is pumped into the vacuole. When the vacuole is full, it pushes the water out of the cell through a pore. 
Summary 	  • Osmosis is the diffusion of water. • In comparing two solutions of unequal solute concentration, the solution with the higher solute concentration is hypertonic, and the solution with the lower concentration is hypotonic. Solutions of equal solute concentration are isotonic.

Can you help me move? What is one of the questions no one likes to be asked? Sometimes the cell needs help moving things as well, or facilitating the diffusion process. And this would be the job of a special type of protein. 
Facilitated  Diffusion 	  What happens if a substance needs assistance to move across or through the plasma membrane? Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of solutes through transport proteins in the plasma membrane. Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport. Even though facilitated diffusion involves transport proteins, it is still passive transport because the solute is moving down the concentration gradient. Small nonpolar molecules can easily diffuse across the cell membrane. However, due to the hydrophobic nature of the lipids that make up cell membranes, polar molecules (such as water) and ions cannot do so. Instead, they diffuse across the membrane through transport proteins. A transport protein completely spans the membrane, and allows certain molecules or ions to diffuse across the membrane. Channel proteins, gated channel proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion. A channel protein, a type of transport protein, acts like a pore in the membrane that lets water molecules or small ions through quickly. Water channel proteins (aquaporins) allow water to diffuse across the membrane at a very fast rate. Ion channel proteins allow ions to diffuse across the membrane. A gated channel protein is a transport protein that opens a "gate," allowing a molecule to pass through the membrane. Gated channels have a binding site that is specific for a given molecule or ion. A stimulus causes the "gate" to open or shut. The stimulus may be chemical or electrical signals, temperature, or mechanical force, depending on the type of gated channel. For example, the sodium gated channels of a nerve cell are stimulated by a chemical signal which causes them to open and allow sodium ions into the cell. Glucose molecules are too big to diffuse through the plasma membrane easily, so they are moved across the membrane through gated channels. In this way glucose diffuses very quickly across a cell membrane, which is important because many cells depend on glucose for energy. A carrier protein is a transport protein that is specific for an ion, molecule, or group of substances. Carrier proteins "carry" the ion or molecule across the membrane by changing shape after the binding of the ion or molecule. Carrier proteins are involved in passive and active transport. A model of a channel protein and carrier proteins is shown in Facilitated diffusion through the cell membrane. Channel proteins and carrier proteins are shown (but not a gated-channel protein). Water molecules and ions move through channel proteins. Other ions or molecules are also carried across the cell membrane by carrier proteins. The ion or molecule binds to the active site of a carrier protein. The carrier protein changes shape, and releases the ion or molecule on the other side of the membrane. The carrier protein then returns to its original shape.

Ion  Channels 	  Ions such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and chloride (Cl−), are important for many cell functions. Because they are charged (polar), these ions do not diffuse through the membrane. Instead they move through ion channel proteins where they are protected from the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Ion channels allow the formation of a concentration gradient between the extracellular fluid and the cytosol. Ion channels are very specific, as they allow only certain ions through the cell membrane. Some ion channels are always open, others are "gated" and can be opened or closed. Gated ion channels can open or close in response to different types of stimuli, such as electrical or chemical signals.

If you did, it would take a lot of energy. Sometimes, moving things into or out of the cell also takes energy. How would the cell move something against a concentration gradient? It starts by using energy. 
Active  Transport 	  In contrast to facilitated diffusion, which does not require energy and carries molecules or ions down a concentration gradient, active transport pumps molecules and ions against a concentration gradient. Sometimes an organism needs to transport something against a concentration gradient. The only way this can be done is through active transport, which uses energy that is produced by respiration (ATP). In active transport, the particles move across a cell membrane from a lower concentration to a higher concentration. Active transport is the energy-requiring process of pumping molecules and ions across membranes "uphill" against a concentration gradient. • The active transport of small molecules or ions across a cell membrane is generally carried out by transport proteins that are found in the membrane. • Larger molecules such as starch can also be actively transported across the cell membrane by processes called endocytosis and exocytosis. 
Homeostasis and  Cell  Function 	  Homeostasis refers to the balance, or equilibrium, within the cell or a body. It is an organism’s ability to keep a constant internal environment. Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments as conditions change inside and outside the cell. The adjusting of systems within a cell is called homeostatic regulation. Because the internal and external environments of a cell are constantly changing, adjustments must be made continuously to stay at or near the set point (the normal level or range). Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium rather than an unchanging state. The cellular processes discussed in both the Diffusion and Active Transport concepts all play an important role in homeostatic regulation. You will learn more about homeostasis in other concepts.

However, active transport processes play a significant role in the function of these cells. Specifically, it is the sodium-potassium pump that is active in the axons of these nerve cells. 
The  Sodium- Potassium  Pump 	  Active transport is the energy-requiring process of pumping molecules and ions across membranes "uphill" against a concentration gradient. To move these molecules against their concentration gradient, a carrier protein is needed. Carrier proteins can work with a concentration gradient (during passive transport), but some carrier proteins can move solutes against the concentration gradient (from low concentration to high concentration), with an input of energy. In active transport, as carrier proteins are used to move materials against their concentration gradient, these proteins are known as pumps. As in other types of cellular activities, ATP supplies the energy for most active transport. One way ATP powers active transport is by transferring a phosphate group directly to a carrier protein. This may cause the carrier protein to change its shape, which moves the molecule or ion to the other side of the membrane. An example of this type of active transport system, as shown in Figure 2.25, is the sodium-potassium pump, which exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions across the plasma membrane of animal cells. As is shown in Figure 2.25, three sodium ions bind with the protein pump inside the cell. The carrier protein then gets energy from ATP and changes shape. In doing so, it pumps the three sodium ions out of the cell. At that point, The sodium-potassium pump system moves sodium and potassium ions against large concentration gradients. It moves two potassium ions into the cell where potassium levels are high, and pumps three sodium ions out of the cell and into the extracellular fluid. two potassium ions from outside the cell bind to the protein pump. The potassium ions are then transported into the cell, and the process repeats. The sodium-potassium pump is found in the plasma membrane of almost every human cell and is common to all cellular life. It helps maintain cell potential and regulates cellular volume. A more detailed look at the sodium-potassium pump is available at URL pQ (13:53) and URL (6:48). Click image to the left or use the URL below. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
The  Electrochemical  Gradient 	  The active transport of ions across the membrane causes an electrical gradient to build up across the plasma membrane. The number of positively charged ions outside the cell is greater than the number of positively charged ions in the cytosol. This results in a relatively negative charge on the inside of the membrane, and a positive charge on the outside. This difference in charges causes a voltage across the membrane. Voltage is electrical potential energy that is caused by a separation of opposite charges, in this case across the membrane. The voltage across a membrane is called membrane potential. Membrane potential is very important for the conduction of electrical impulses along nerve cells. Because the inside of the cell is negative compared to outside the cell, the membrane potential favors the movement of positively charged ions (cations) into the cell, and the movement of negative ions (anions) out of the cell. So, there are two forces that drive the diffusion of ions across the plasma membrane—a chemical force (the ions’ concentration gradient), and an electrical force (the effect of the membrane potential on the ions’ movement). These two forces working together are called an electrochemical gradient, and will be discussed in detail in "Nerve Cells" and "Nerve Impulses" concepts.

Vesicle  Transport 	  Some molecules or particles are just too large to pass through the plasma membrane or to move through a transport protein. So cells use two other active transport processes to move these macromolecules (large molecules) into or out of the cell. Vesicles or other bodies in the cytoplasm move macromolecules or large particles across the plasma membrane. There are two types of vesicle transport, endocytosis and exocytosis (illustrated in Figure 2.26). Both processes are active transport processes, requiring energy. 
Endocytosis and  Exocytosis 	  Endocytosis is the process of capturing a substance or particle from outside the cell by engulfing it with the cell membrane. The membrane folds over the substance and it becomes completely enclosed by the membrane. At this point a membrane-bound sac, or vesicle, pinches off and moves the substance into the cytosol. There are two main kinds of endocytosis:

The plasma membrane engulfs the solid material, forming a phagocytic vesicle. • Pinocytosis, or cellular drinking, occurs when the plasma membrane folds inward to form a channel allowing dissolved substances to enter the cell, as shown in Figure 2.27. When the channel is closed, the liquid is encircled within a pinocytic vesicle.

Exocytosis describes the process of vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane and releasing their contents to the outside of the cell, as shown in Figure 2.28. Exocytosis occurs when a cell produces substances for export, such as a protein, or when the cell is getting rid of a waste product or a toxin. Newly made membrane proteins and membrane lipids are moved on top the plasma membrane by exocytosis.

Name one major difference between a plant and an animal. There are many differences, but in terms of energy, it all starts with sunlight. Plants absorb the energy from the sun and turn it into food. You can sit in the sun for hours and hours. You will feel warm, but you’re not going to absorb any energy. You have to eat to obtain your energy. 
Autotrophs vs.  Heterotrophs 	  Living organisms obtain chemical energy in one of two ways. Autotrophs, shown in Figure 2.29, store chemical energy in carbohydrate food molecules they build themselves. Food is chemical energy stored in organic molecules. Food provides both the energy to do work and the carbon to build bodies. Because most autotrophs transform sunlight to make food, we call the process they use photosynthesis. Only three groups of organisms plants, algae, and some bacteria are capable of this life-giving energy transformation. Autotrophs make food for their own use, but they make enough to support other life as well. Almost all other organisms depend absolutely on these three groups for the food they produce. The producers, as autotrophs are also known, begin food chains which feed all life. Food chains will be discussed in the "Food Chains and Food Webs" concept. Heterotrophs cannot make their own food, so they must eat or absorb it. For this reason, heterotrophs are also known as consumers. Consumers include all animals and fungi and many protists and bacteria. They may consume autotrophs or other heterotrophs or organic molecules from other organisms. Heterotrophs show great diversity and may appear far more fascinating than producers. But heterotrophs are limited by our utter dependence on those autotrophs that originally made our food. If plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria vanished from earth, animals, fungi, and other heterotrophs would soon disappear as well. All life requires a constant input of energy. Only autotrophs can transform that ultimate, solar source into the chemical energy in food that powers life, as shown in Photosynthetic autotrophs, which make food using the energy in sunlight, include (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) certain bacteria. Photosynthesis provides over 99 percent of the energy for life on earth. A much smaller group of autotrophs mostly bacteria in dark or low-oxygen environments produce food using the chemical energy stored in inorganic molecules such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, or methane. While photosynthesis transforms light energy to chemical energy, this alternate method of making food transfers chemical energy from inorganic to organic molecules. It is therefore called chemosynthesis, and is characteristic of the tubeworms shown in Figure 2.31. Some of the most recently discovered chemosynthetic bacteria inhabit deep ocean hot water vents or “black smokers.” There, they use the energy in gases from the Earth’s interior to produce food for a variety of unique heterotrophs: giant tube worms, blind shrimp, giant white crabs, and armored snails. Some scientists think that chemosynthesis may support life below the surface of Mars, Jupiter’s moon, Europa, and other planets as well. Ecosystems based on chemosynthesis may seem rare and exotic, but they too illustrate the absolute dependence of heterotrophs on autotrophs for food. 
Making and  Using  Food 	  The flow of energy through living organisms begins with photosynthesis. This process stores energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of glucose. By breaking the chemical bonds in glucose, cells release the stored energy and make A food chain shows how energy and matter flow from producers to consumers.

Though this 	  food chains "ends" with decomposers, do decomposers, in fact, digest matter from each level of the food chain? (see the "Flow of Energy" concept.) 
Tubeworms deep in the  Galapagos  Rift 	  get their energy from chemosynthetic bacteria living within their tissues. No digestive systems needed! the ATP they need. The process in which glucose is broken down and ATP is made is called cellular respiration. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are like two sides of the same coin. This is apparent from Figure 2.32. The products of one process are the reactants of the other. Together, the two processes store and release energy in living organisms. The two processes also work together to recycle oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere. 
Photosynthesis 	  Photosynthesis is often considered to be the single most important life process on Earth. It changes light energy into chemical energy and also releases oxygen. Without photosynthesis, there would be no oxygen in the atmosphere. Photosynthesis involves many chemical reactions, but they can be summed up in a single chemical equation: Photosynthetic autotrophs capture light energy from the sun and absorb carbon dioxide and water from their environ-

Using the light energy, they combine the reactants to produce glucose and oxygen, which is a waste product. They store the glucose, usually as starch, and they release the oxygen into the atmosphere. 
Cellular  Respiration 	  Cellular respiration actually “burns” glucose for energy. However, it doesn’t produce light or intense heat as some other types of burning do. This is because it releases the energy in glucose slowly, in many small steps. It uses the energy that is released to form molecules of ATP. Cellular respiration involves many chemical reactions, which can be summed up with this chemical equation: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + Chemical Energy (in ATP) Cellular respiration occurs in the cells of all living things. heterotrophs. All of them burn glucose to form ATP.

Needs lots of energy? To run a marathon, probably. Where does this extra energy come from? Carbohydrate loading is a strategy used by endurance athletes to maximize the storage of energy, in the form of glycogen, in the muscles. Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, which is then turned into ATP through the process of cellular respiration. 
Energy- Carrying  Molecules 	  You know that the fish you had for lunch contained protein molecules. But do you know that the atoms in that protein could easily have formed the color in a dragonfly’s eye, the heart of a water flea, and the whiplike tail of a Euglena before they hit your plate as sleek fish muscle? Food consists of organic (carbon-containing) molecules which store energy in the chemical bonds between their atoms. Organisms use the atoms of food molecules to build larger organic molecules including proteins, DNA, and fats (lipids) and use the energy in food to power life processes. By breaking the bonds in food molecules, cells release energy to build new compounds. Although some energy dissipates as heat at each energy transfer, much of it is stored in the newly made molecules. Chemical bonds in organic molecules are a reservoir of the energy used to make them. Fueled by the energy from food molecules, cells can combine and recombine the elements of life to form thousands of different molecules. Both the energy (despite some loss) and the materials (despite being reorganized) pass from producer to consumer – perhaps from algal tails, to water flea hearts, to dragonfly eye colors, to fish muscle, to you! The process of photosynthesis, which usually begins the flow of energy through life, uses many different kinds of energy-carrying molecules to transform sunlight energy into chemical energy and build food. Some carrier molecules hold energy briefly, quickly shifting it like a hot potato to other molecules. This strategy allows energy to be released in small, controlled amounts. An example starts in chlorophyll, the green pigment present in most plants, which helps convert solar energy to chemical energy. When a chlorophyll molecule absorbs light energy, electrons are excited and "jump" to a higher energy level. The excited electrons then bounce to a series of carrier molecules, losing a little energy at each step. Most of the "lost" energy powers some small cellular task, such as moving ions across a membrane or building up another molecule. Another short-term energy carrier important to photosynthesis, NADPH, holds chemical energy a bit longer but soon "spends" it to help to build sugar. Two of the most important energy-carrying molecules are glucose and adenosine triphosphate, commonly referred to as ATP. These are nearly universal fuels throughout the living world and are both key players in photosynthesis, as shown below. 
Glucose 	  A molecule of glucose, which has the chemical formula C6H12O6, carries a packet of chemical energy just the right size for transport and uptake by cells. In your body, glucose is the "deliverable" form of energy, carried in your blood through capillaries to each of your 100 trillion cells. Glucose is also the carbohydrate produced by photosynthesis, and as such is the near-universal food for life. Glucose is the energy-rich product of photosynthesis, a universal food for life. 
It 	  is also the primary form in which your bloodstream delivers energy to every cell in your body. 
 	  ATP molecules store smaller quantities of energy, but each releases just the right amount to actually do work within a cell. Muscle cell proteins, for example, pull each other with the energy released when bonds in ATP break open (discussed below). The process of photosynthesis also makes and uses ATP for energy to build glucose! ATP, then, is the useable form of energy for your cells. ATP is commonly referred to as the "energy currency" of the cell. Why do we need both glucose and ATP? Why don’t plants just make ATP and be done with it? If energy were money, ATP would be a quarter. Enough money to operate a parking meter or washing machine. Glucose would be a ten dollar bill – much easier to carry around in your wallet, but too large to do the actual work of paying for parking or washing. Just as we find several denominations of money useful, organisms need several "denominations" of energy – a smaller quantity for work within cells, and a larger quantity for stable storage, transport, and delivery to cells. (Actually a glucose molecule would be about $9.50, as under the proper conditions, up to 38 ATP are produced for each glucose molecule.) Let’s take a closer look at a molecule of ATP. Although it carries less energy than glucose, its structure is more complex. The "A" in ATP refers to the majority of the molecule, adenosine, a combination of a nitrogenous base and a five-carbon sugar. The "TP" indicates the three phosphates, linked by bonds which hold the energy actually used by cells. Usually, only the outermost bond breaks to release or spend energy for cellular work. An ATP molecule, shown in the Figure 2.34, is like a rechargeable battery: its energy can be used by the cell when it breaks apart into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate, and then the "worn-out battery" ADP can be recharged using new energy to attach a new phosphate and rebuild ATP. The materials are recyclable, but recall that energy is not! How much energy does it cost to do your body’s work? A single cell uses about 10 million ATP molecules per second, and recycles all of its ATP molecules about every 20-30 seconds. 
An arrow shows the bond between two 	  phosphate groups in an ATP molecule. When this bond breaks, its chemical energy can do cellular work. The resulting ADP molecule is recycled when new energy attaches another phosphate, rebuilding ATP. A explanation of ATP as "biological energy" is found at URL .

The chloroplast contains many of these internal membranes, making photosynthesis very efficient. These internal membranes stack on top of each other, just like a stack of pancakes. 
Stages of  Photosynthesis 	  Photosynthesis occurs in two stages, which are shown in Figure 2.35. energy stored in ATP and NADPH (another energy-carrying molecule). This stage also releases oxygen as a waste product. chemical energy in ATP and NADPH to make glucose. Before you read about these two stages of photosynthesis in greater detail, you need to know more about the chloroplast, where the two stages take place. 
The two stages of photosynthesis are the 	  light reactions and the Calvin cycle. Do you see how the two stages are related? Photosynthesis, the process of turning the energy of sunlight into ”food,” is divided into two basic sets of reactions, known as the light reactions and the Calvin cycle, which uses carbon dioxide. As you study the details in other concepts, refer frequently to the chemical equation of photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy → C6H12O6 + If you examine a single leaf of a Winter Jasmine leaf, shown in Figure 2.36, under a microscope, you will see within each cell dozens of small green ovals. These are chloroplasts, the organelles which conduct photosynthesis in plants and algae. Chloroplasts closely resemble some types of bacteria and even contain their own circular DNA and ribosomes. In fact, the endosymbiotic theory holds that chloroplasts were once independently living bacteria (prokaryotes). So when we say that photosynthesis occurs within chloroplasts, we speak not only of the organelles within plants and algae, but also of some bacteria –in other words, virtually all photosynthetic autotrophs. Each chloroplast contains neat stacks called grana (singular, granum). The grana consist of sac-like membranes, known as thylakoid membranes. These membranes contain photosystems, which are groups of molecules that include chlorophyll, a green pigment. The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes. The stroma is the space outside the thylakoid membranes, as shown in Figure 2.37. This is where the reactions of the Calvin cycle take place. In addition to enzymes, two basic types of molecules pigments and electron carriers –are key players in this process and are also found in the thylakoid membranes. You can take a video tour of a chloroplast at Encyclopedia Britannica: Chloroplast: URL checked/media/16440/Chloroplasts-circulate-within-plant-cells . Electron carrier molecules are usually arranged in electron transport chains (ETCs). These accept and pass along energy-carrying electrons in small steps ( Figure 2.38). In this way, they produce ATP and NADPH, which temporarily store chemical energy. Electrons in transport chains behave much like a ball bouncing down a set of stairs –a little energy is lost with each bounce.

It is a ”leftover” from a necessary part of the process. All the oxygen that is necessary to maintain most forms of life just happens to come about during this process. 
Photosynthesis  Stage  I:  The  Light  Reactions 	  An overview of photosynthesis is available at URL (13:37). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Chloroplasts  Capture  Sunlight 	  Every second, the sun fuses over 600 million tons of hydrogen into 596 tons of helium, converting over 4 tons of helium (4.3 billion kg) into light and heat energy. Countless tiny packets of that light energy travel 93 million miles (150 million km) through space, and about 1% of the light which reaches the Earth’s surface participates in photosynthesis. Light is the source of energy for photosynthesis, and the first set of reactions which begin the process requires light –thus the name, light reactions, or light-dependent reactions. When light strikes chlorophyll (or an accessory pigment) within the chloroplast, it energizes electrons within that molecule. These electrons jump up to higher energy levels; they have absorbed or captured, and now carry, that energy. High-energy electrons are “excited.” Who wouldn’t be excited to hold the energy for life? The excited electrons leave chlorophyll to participate in further reactions, leaving the chlorophyll “at a loss”; eventually they must be replaced. That replacement process also requires light, working with an enzyme complex to split water molecules. In this process of photolysis (“splitting by light”), H2O molecules are broken into hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen atoms. The electrons replace those originally lost from chlorophyll. Hydrogen ions and the high-energy electrons from chlorophyll will carry on the energy transformation drama after the light reactions are over. The oxygen atoms, however, form oxygen gas, which is a waste product of photosynthesis. The oxygen given off supplies most of the oxygen in our atmosphere. Before photosynthesis evolved, Earth’s atmosphere lacked oxygen altogether, and this highly reactive gas was toxic to the many organisms living at the time. Something had to change! Most contemporary organisms rely on oxygen for efficient respiration. So plants don’t just “restore” the air, they also had a major role in creating it! To summarize, chloroplasts “capture” sunlight energy in two ways. Light ”excites” electrons in pigment molecules, and light provides the energy to split water molecules, providing more electrons as well as hydrogen ions. 
Light  Energy to  Chemical  Energy 	  Excited electrons that have absorbed light energy are unstable. However, the highly organized electron carrier molecules embedded in chloroplast membranes order the flow of these electrons, directing them through electron transport chains (ETCs). At each transfer, small amounts of energy released by the electrons are captured and put to work or stored. Some is also lost as heat with each transfer, but overall the light reactions are extremely efficient at capturing light energy and transforming it into chemical energy. Two sequential transport chains harvest the energy of excited electrons, as shown in Figure 2.39. (1) First, they pass down an ETC, which captures their energy and uses it to pump hydrogen ions by active transport into the thylakoids. These concentrated ions store potential energy by forming a chemiosmotic or electrochemical gradient –a higher concentration of both positive charge and hydrogen inside the thylakoid than outside. (The gradient formed by the H+ ions is known as a chemiosmotic gradient.) Picture this energy buildup of H+ as a dam holding back a waterfall. Like water flowing through a hole in the dam, hydrogen ions “slide down” their concentration gradient through a membrane protein which acts as both ion channel and enzyme. As they flow, the ion channel/enzyme ATP synthase uses their energy to chemically bond a phosphate group to ADP, making ATP. (2) Light re-energizes the electrons, and they travel down a second electron transport chain (ETC), eventually bonding hydrogen ions to NADP+ to form a more stable energy storage molecule, NADPH. NADPH is sometimes called “hot hydrogen,” and its energy and hydrogen atoms will be used to help build sugar in the second stage of photosynthesis. Membrane architecture: The large colored carrier molecules form electron transport chains which capture small amounts of energy from excited electrons in order to store it in ATP and NADPH. Follow the energy pathways: light → electrons → NADPH (blue line) and light → electrons → concentrated H+ → ATP (red line). Note the intricate organization of the chloroplast. NADPH and ATP molecules now store the energy from excited electrons –energy which was originally sunlight –in chemical bonds. Thus chloroplasts, with their orderly arrangement of pigments, enzymes, and electron transport chains, transform light energy into chemical energy. The first stage of photosynthesis –light-dependent reactions or simply light reactions –is complete. For a detailed discussion of photosynthesis, see URL (20:16) and http ://URL (18:51).

The energy from sunlight is briefly held in NADPH and ATP, which is needed to drive the formation of sugars such as glucose. And this all happens in the Calvin cycle. 
Making  Food “ From  Thin  Air” 	  You’ve learned that the first, light-dependent stage of photosynthesis uses two of the three reactants, water and light, and produces one of the products, oxygen gas (a waste product of this process). All three necessary conditions are required –chlorophyll pigments, the chloroplast “theater,” and enzyme catalysts. The first stage transforms light energy into chemical energy, stored to this point in molecules of ATP and NADPH. Look again at the overall equation below. What is left? Waiting in the wings is one more reactant, carbon dioxide, and yet to come is the star product, which is food for all life –glucose. These key players perform in the second act of the photosynthesis drama, in which food is “made from thin air!” The second stage of photosynthesis can proceed without light, so its steps are sometimes called “light-independent” or “dark” reactions (though the term ”dark” reactions can be misleading). Many biologists honor the scientist, Melvin Calvin, who won a 1961 Nobel Prize for working out this complex set of chemical reactions, naming it the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle has two parts. First carbon dioxide is ”fixed”. Then ATP and NADPH from the light reactions provide energy to combine the fixed carbons to make sugar. The Calvin cycle is discussed at URL (13:28). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Carbon  Dioxide is “ Fixed” 	  Why does carbon dioxide need to be fixed? Was it ever broken? Life on Earth is carbon-based. Organisms need not only energy but also carbon atoms for building bodies. For nearly all life, the ultimate source of carbon is carbon dioxide (CO2), an inorganic molecule. CO2 makes up less than 1% of the Earth’s atmosphere. Animals and most other heterotrophs cannot take in CO2 directly. They must eat other organisms or absorb organic molecules to get carbon. Only autotrophs can build low-energy inorganic CO2 into high-energy organic molecules like glucose. This process is carbon fixation. Plants have evolved three pathways for carbon fixation. The most common pathway combines one molecule of CO2 with a 5-carbon sugar called ribulose biphosphate (RuBP). The enzyme which catalyzes this reaction (nicknamed RuBisCo) is the most abundant enzyme on earth! The resulting 6-carbon molecule is unstable, so it immediately splits into two 3-carbon molecules. The 3 carbons in the first stable molecule of this pathway give this largest group of plants the name “C3.” Dry air, hot temperatures, and bright sunlight slow the C3 pathway for carbon fixation. This is because stomata, tiny openings under the leaf which normally allow CO2 to enter and O2 to leave, must close to prevent loss of water vapor ( Figure 2.40). Closed stomata lead to a shortage of CO2. Two alternative pathways for carbon fixation demonstrate biochemical adaptations to differing environments. Plants such as corn solve the problem by using a separate compartment to fix CO2. Here CO2 combines with a adaptation has the name C4. Shuttled away from the initial fixation site, the 4-carbon molecule is actually broken back down into CO2, and when enough accumulates, RuBisCo fixes it a second time! Compartmentalization allows efficient use of low concentrations of carbon dioxide in these specialized plants. See URL (16:58) for further information. 
Stomata on the underside of leaves take 	  in CO2 and release water and O2. Guard cells close the stomata when water is scarce. Leaf cross-section (above) and stoma (below). Click image to the left or use the URL below. Cacti and succulents such as the jade plant avoid water loss by fixing CO2 only at night. These plants close their stomata during the day and open them only in the cooler and more humid nighttime hours. Leaf structure differs slightly from that of C4 plants, but the fixation pathways are similar. The family of plants in which this pathway was discovered gives the pathway its name, Crassulacean Acid Metabolism, or CAM ( Figure 2.41). All three carbon fixation pathways lead to the Calvin cycle to build sugar. See URL (8:37) for further information. Click image to the left or use the URL below. Even chemical reactions adapt to specific environments! Carbon fixation pathways vary among three groups. Temperate species (maple tree, left) use the C3 pathway. C4 species (corn, center) concentrate CO2 in a separate compartment to lessen water loss in hot bright climates. Desert plants (jade plant, right) fix CO2 only at night, closing stomata in the daytime to conserve water. How Does the Calvin Cycle Store Energy in Sugar? As Melvin Calvin discovered, carbon fixation is the first step of a cycle. Like an electron transport chain, the Calvin cycle, shown in Figure 2.42, transfers energy in small, controlled steps. Each step pushes molecules uphill in terms of energy content. Recall that in the electron transfer chain, excited electrons lose energy to NADPH and ATP. In the Calvin cycle, NADPH and ATP formed in the light reactions lose their stored chemical energy to build glucose. Use the Figure 2.42 to identify the major aspects of the process: • the general cycle pattern • the major reactants • the products First, notice where carbon is fixed by the enzyme nicknamed RuBisCo. In C3, C4, and CAM plants, CO2 enters the cycle by joining with 5-carbon ribulose bisphosphate to form a 6-carbon intermediate, which splits (so quickly that it isn’t even shown!) into two 3-carbon molecules. Overview of the Calvin Cycle Pathway. Now look for the points at which ATP and NADPH (made in the light reactions) add chemical energy (“Reduction” in the diagram) to the 3-carbon molecules. The resulting “half-sugars” can enter several different metabolic pathways. One recreates the original 5-carbon precursor, completing the cycle. A second combines two of the 3-carbon molecules to form glucose, universal fuel for life. The cycle begins and ends with the same molecule, but the process combines carbon and energy to build carbohydrates –food for life. So, how does photosynthesis store energy in sugar? Six “turns” of the Calvin cycle use chemical energy from ATP to combine six carbon atoms from six CO2 molecules with 12 “hot hydrogens” from NADPH. The result is one molecule of glucose, C6H12O6. 
Summary 	  • The reactions of the Calvin cycle add carbon (from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) to a simple five-carbon molecule called RuBP. • These reactions use chemical energy from NADPH and ATP that were produced in the light reactions. • The final product of the Calvin cycle is glucose. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Photosynthesis at URL . this product? • Summarize photosynthesis. What is photosynthesis? The process of using the energy in sunlight to make food (glucose). Is it really as simple as that? Of course not. As you have seen, photosynthesis includes many steps all conveniently condensed into one simple equation. In the five concepts describing photosynthesis, this process has been presented in an introductory fashion. Obviously, much more details could have been included, though those are beyond the scope of these concepts. 
Summary 	  The following 10 points summarize photosynthesis. • 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 • Autotrophs store chemical energy in carbohydrate food molecules they build themselves. Most autotrophs make their "food" through photosynthesis using the energy of the sun. • Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast, an organelle specific to plant cells. • The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. • Electron carrier molecules are arranged in electron transport chains that produce ATP and NADPH, which temporarily store chemical energy. • The light reactions capture energy from sunlight, which they change to chemical energy that is stored in molecules of NADPH and ATP. • The light reactions also release oxygen gas as a waste product. • The reactions of the Calvin cycle add carbon (from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) to a simple five-carbon molecule called RuBP. • The Calvin cycle reactions use chemical energy from NADPH and ATP that were produced in the light reactions. • The final product of the Calvin cycle is glucose. 
Qs 	  • What is photosynthesis? The process of using the energy in sunlight to make food (glucose). But of course it is much more complex than that simple statement. Photosynthesis is a multistep biochemical pathway that uses the energy in sunlight to fix carbon dioxide, transferring the energy into carbohydrates, and releasing oxygen in the process. • What is NADPH? Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, an energy carrier molecule produced in the light reactions of photosynthesis. NADPH is the reduced form of the electron acceptor NADP+. At the end of the light reactions, the energy from sunlight is transferred to NADP+, producing NADPH. This energy in NADPH is then used in the Calvin cycle. • Where do the protons used in the light reactions come from? The protons used in the light reactions come from photolysis, the splitting of water, in which H2O molecules are broken into hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen atoms. In addition, the energy from sunlight is used to pump protons into the thylakoid lumen during the first electron transport chain, forming a chemiosmotic gradient. • How do you distinguish between the Calvin cycle and the Krebs cycle? The Calvin cycle is part of the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. The Calvin cycle uses ATP and NADPH. The Krebs cycle is part of cellular respiration. This cycle makes ATP and NAPH. • Do photosynthesis and cellular respiration occur at the same time in a plant? Yes. Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts, whereas cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria. Photosynthesis makes glucose and oxygen, which are then used as the starting products for cellular respiration. Cellular respiration makes carbon dioxide and water (and ATP), which are the starting products (together with sunlight) for photosynthesis. 
Common  Misconceptions 	  • A common student misconception is that plants photosynthesize only during daylight and conduct cellular respiration only at night. Some teaching literature even states this. Though it is true the light reactions can only occur when the sun is out, cellular respiration occurs continuously in plants, not just at night. • The “dark reactions” of photosynthesis are a misnomer that often leads students to believe that photosynthetic It is preferable to use the term Calvin cycle or lightcarbon fixation occurs at night. This is not true. independent reactions instead of dark reactions. • Though the final product of photosynthesis is glucose, the glucose is conveniently stored as starch. Starch is approximated as (C6H10O5)n, where n is in the thousands. Starch is formed by the condensation of thousands of glucose molecules. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Avoid Misconceptions When Teaching About Plants at URL y.html • Define chemosynthesis. • Describe organisms that use chemosynthesis. Is it possible to live in temperatures over 175°F? It is if you’re a Pompeii worm. The Pompeii worm, the most heat-tolerant animal on Earth, lives in the deep ocean at super-heated hydrothermal vents. Covering this deep-sea worm’s back is a fleece of bacteria. These microbes contain all the genes necessary for life in extreme environments. 
Chemosynthesis 	  Why do bacteria that live deep below the ocean’s surface rely on chemical compounds instead of sunlight for energy to make food? Most autotrophs make food by photosynthesis, but this isn’t the only way that autotrophs produce food. Some bacteria make food by another process, which uses chemical energy instead of light energy. This process is called chemosynthesis. In chemosynthesis, one or more carbon molecules (usually carbon dioxide or methane, CH4) and nutrients is converted into organic matter, using the oxidation of inorganic molecules (such as hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or ammonia (NH3)) or methane as a source of energy, rather than sunlight. In hydrogen sulfide chemosynthesis, in the presence of carbon dioxide and oxygen, carbohydrates (CH2O) can be produced: CO2 + O2 + 4H2S → CH2O + 4S + 3H2O Many organisms that use chemosynthesis are extremophiles, living in harsh conditions, such as in the absence of sunlight and a wide range of water temperatures, some approaching the boiling point. Some chemosynthetic bacteria live around deep-ocean vents known as “black smokers.” Compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, which flow out of the vents from Earth’s interior, are used by the bacteria for energy to make food. Consumers that depend on these bacteria to produce food for them include giant tubeworms, like those pictured in Figure 2.43. These organisms are known as chemoautotrophs. Many chemosynthetic microorganisms are consumed by other organisms in the ocean, and symbiotic associations between these organisms and respiring heterotrophs are quite common. 
Tubeworms deep in the  Galapagos  Rift 	  get their energy from chemosynthetic bacteria. Tubeworms have no mouth, eyes or stomach. Their survival depends on a symbiotic relationship with the billions of bacteria that live inside them. 
These bacteria convert the chemicals that 	  shoot out of the hydrothermal vents into food for the worm.

How long can you hold your breath? With or without air? In terms of producing energy, that is the key question. Can cellular respiration occur without air? It can, but it does have limitations. 
The  Presence of  Oxygen 	  There are two types of cellular respiration (see Cellular Respiration concept): aerobic and anaerobic. One occurs in the presence of oxygen ( aerobic), and one occurs in the absence of oxygen ( anaerobic). Both begin with glycolysis the splitting of glucose. Glycolysis (see "Glycolysis" concept) is an anaerobic process it does not need oxygen to proceed. This process produces a minimal amount of ATP. The Krebs cycle and electron transport do need oxygen to proceed, and in the presence of oxygen, these process produce much more ATP than glycolysis alone. Scientists think that glycolysis evolved before the other stages of cellular respiration. This is because the other stages need oxygen, whereas glycolysis does not, and there was no oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere when life first evolved about 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. Cellular respiration that proceeds without oxygen is called anaerobic respiration. Then, about 2 or 3 billion years ago, oxygen was gradually added to the atmosphere by early photosynthetic bacteria (cyanobacteria). After that, living things could use oxygen to break down glucose and make ATP. Today, most organisms make ATP with oxygen. They follow glycolysis with the Krebs cycle and electron transport to make more ATP than by glycolysis alone. Cellular respiration that proceeds in the presence of oxygen is called aerobic respiration. 
Summary 	  • Cellular respiration always begins with glycolysis, which can occur either in the absence or presence of oxygen. • Cellular respiration that proceeds in the absence of oxygen is anaerobic respiration. • Cellular respiration that proceeds in the presence of oxygen is aerobic respiration. • Anaerobic respiration evolved prior to aerobic respiration.

Why eat? Because we’re hungry. Not necessarily. But biologically speaking. . . we eat to get energy. The food we eat is broken down, the glucose extracted, and that energy is converted into ATP. 
Cellular  Respiration 	  What happens to the energy stored in glucose during photosynthesis? How do living things make use of this stored energy? The answer is cellular respiration. This process releases the energy in glucose to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the molecule that powers all the work of cells. An introduction to cellular respiration can be viewed at URL (14:19). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Stages of  Cellular  Respiration 	  Cellular respiration involves many chemical reactions. The reactions can be summed up in this equation: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + Chemical Energy (in ATP) The reactions of cellular respiration can be grouped into three stages: glycolysis (stage 1), the Krebs cycle, also called the citric acid cycle (stage 2), and electron transport (stage 3). Figure 2.44 gives an overview of these three stages, which are further discussed in the concepts that follow. Glycolysis occurs in the cytosol of the cell and does not require oxygen, whereas the Krebs cycle and electron transport occur in the mitochondria and do require oxygen. 
Cellular 	  respiration takes place in the stages shown here. The process begins with a molecule of glucose, which has six carbon atoms. What happens to each of these atoms of carbon? 
Structure of the  Mitochondrion:  Key to  Aerobic  Respiration 	  The structure of the mitochondrion is key to the process of aerobic (in the presence of oxygen) cellular respiration, especially the Krebs cycle and electron transport. A diagram of a mitochondrion is shown in Figure 2.45. As you can see from Figure 2.45, a mitochondrion has an inner and outer membrane. The space between the inner and outer membrane is called the intermembrane space. The space enclosed by the inner membrane is called the matrix. The second stage of cellular respiration, the Krebs cycle, takes place in the matrix. The third stage, electron transport, takes place on the inner membrane. 
Summary 	  • Cellular respiration takes the energy stored in glucose and transfers it to ATP. • Cellular respiration has three stages: glycolysis: the Krebs cycle and electron transport. • The inner and outer membranes of the mitochondrion play an important roles in aerobic respiration. The structure of a mitochondrion is defined by an inner and outer membrane.

What type of cellular respiration would you predict that the new species uses? Explain your prediction. the water vapor come from? • Summarize glycolysis. • List the products of glycolysis. How do you slice a molecule of glucose in half? With sharp knives? Not really. But you essentially slice it in half through glycolysis. This is an extremely important part of cellular respiration. It happens all the time, both with and without oxygen. And in the process, transfers some energy to ATP. 
Cellular  Respiration  Stage  I:  Glycolysis 	  The first stage of cellular respiration is glycolysis. It does not require oxygen, and it does not take place in the mitochondrion it takes place in the cytosol of the cytoplasm. When was the last time you enjoyed yogurt on your breakfast cereal, or had a tetanus shot? These experiences may appear unconnected, but both relate to bacteria which do not use oxygen to make ATP. In fact, tetanus bacteria cannot survive if oxygen is present. However, Lactobacillus acidophilus (bacteria which make yogurt) and Clostridium tetani (bacteria which cause tetanus or lockjaw) share with nearly all organisms the first stage of cellular respiration, glycolysis. Because glycolysis is universal, whereas aerobic (oxygen-requiring) cellular respiration is not, most biologists consider it to be the most fundamental and primitive pathway for making ATP. 
Splitting  Glucose 	  The word glycolysis means “glucose splitting,” which is exactly what happens in this stage. Enzymes split a molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (also known as pyruvic acid). This occurs in several steps, as shown in JGXayUyNVw . 
In glycolysis, glucose ( C6) is split into two 	  releases energy, which is transferred to 
P.  How many  P molecules are made 	  during this stage of cellular respiration? 
Results of  Glycolysis 	  Energy is needed at the start of glycolysis to split the glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules. These two molecules go on to stage II of cellular respiration. The energy to split glucose is provided by two molecules of ATP. As glycolysis proceeds, energy is released, and the energy is used to make four molecules of ATP. As a result, there is a net gain of two ATP molecules during glycolysis. During this stage, high-energy electrons are also transferred to molecules of NAD+ to produce two molecules of NADH, another energy-carrying molecule. NADH is used in stage III of cellular respiration to make more ATP. A summary of glycolysis can be viewed at URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below.

What type of acid do these fruits contain? Citric acid. Citric acid is also the first product formed in the Krebs cycle, and therefore this acid occurs in the metabolism of virtually all living things. 
Cellular  Respiration  Stage  I:  The  Krebs  Cycle 	  Recall that glycolysis, stage I of cellular respiration, produces two molecules of pyruvate. These molecules enter the matrix of a mitochondrion, where they start the Krebs cycle. The reactions that occur next are shown in Figure Before the Krebs cycle begins, pyruvic acid, which has three carbon atoms, is split apart and combined with an enzyme known as CoA, which stands for coenzyme A. The product of this reaction is a two-carbon molecule called acetyl-CoA. The third carbon from pyruvic acid combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, which is released as a waste product. High-energy electrons are also released and captured in NADH. 
Steps of the  Krebs  Cycle 	  The Krebs cycle itself actually begins when acetyl-CoA combines with a four-carbon molecule called OAA (oxaloacetate) (see Figure 2.47). This produces citric acid, which has six carbon atoms. This is why the Krebs cycle is also called the citric acid cycle. 
The  Krebs cycle starts with pyruvic acid 	  from glycolysis. 
Each small circle in 	  the diagram represents one carbon atom. 
For example, citric acid is a six carbon 	  molecule, and OAA (oxaloacetate) is a four carbon molecule. Follow what happens to the carbon atoms as the cycle proceeds. In one turn through the cycle, how many molecules are produced of 
P?  How many molecules of  H and 	  FADH2 are produced? After citric acid forms, it goes through a series of reactions that release energy. The energy is captured in molecules of NADH, ATP, and FADH2, another energy-carrying compound. Carbon dioxide is also released as a waste product of these reactions. The final step of the Krebs cycle regenerates OAA, the molecule that began the Krebs cycle. This molecule is needed for the next turn through the cycle. Two turns are needed because glycolysis produces two pyruvic acid molecules when it splits glucose. Watch the OSU band present the Krebs cycle: URL 
Results of the  Krebs  Cycle 	  After the second turn through the Krebs cycle, the original glucose molecule has been broken down completely. All six of its carbon atoms have combined with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. The energy from its chemical bonds has been stored in a total of 16 energy-carrier molecules. These molecules are: • 4 ATP (including 2 from glycolysis) • 10 NADH (including 2 from glycolysis) • 2 FADH2 The Krebs cycle is reviewed at URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Train, truck, boat or plane? Ways to transport. To make ATP, energy must be ”transported” first from glucose to NADH, and then somehow passed to ATP. How is this done? With an electron transport chain. 
Cellular  Respiration  Stage  I:  Electron  Transport 	  Electron transport is the final stage of aerobic respiration. In this stage, energy from NADH and FADH2, which result from the Krebs cycle, is transferred to ATP. Can you predict how this happens? (Hint: How does electron transport occur in photosynthesis?) See URL for an overview of the electron transport chain. 
Transporting  Electrons 	  High-energy electrons are released from NADH and FADH2, and they move along electron transport chains, like those used in photosynthesis. The electron transport chains are on the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. As the high-energy electrons are transported along the chains, some of their energy is captured. This energy is used to pump hydrogen ions (from NADH and FADH2) across the inner membrane, from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Electron transport in a mitochondrion is shown in Figure 2.48. Electron-transport chains on the inner membrane of the mitochondrion carry out the last stage of cellular respiration. 
Making  	  The pumping of hydrogen ions across the inner membrane creates a greater concentration of the ions in the intermembrane space than in the matrix. This chemiosmotic gradient causes the ions to flow back across the membrane into the matrix, where their concentration is lower. ATP synthase acts as a channel protein, helping the hydrogen ions cross the membrane. It also acts as an enzyme, forming ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. After passing through the electron-transport chain, the “spent” electrons combine with oxygen to form water. This is why oxygen is needed; in the absence of oxygen, this process cannot occur. How much ATP is produced? The two NADH produced in the cytoplasm produces 2 to 3 ATP each (4 to 6 total) by the electron transport system, the 8 NADH produced in the mitochondria produces three ATP each (24 total), and the 2 FADH2 adds its electrons to the electron transport system at a lower level than NADH, so they produce two ATP each (4 total). This results in the formation of 34 ATP during the electron transport stage. A summary of this process can be seen at the following sites: URL (17:16) and URL (4:59).

When you combine grapes and yeast, what have you begun to make? Wine. It may be slightly more complicated than that, but you need to start with grapes and yeast, and allow a natural fermentation process to occur. Essentially, this is respiration without oxygen. 
Anaerobic  Respiration:  Fermentation 	  Today, most living things use oxygen to make ATP from glucose. However, many living things can also make ATP without oxygen. This is true of some plants and fungi and also of many bacteria. These organisms use aerobic respiration when oxygen is present, but when oxygen is in short supply, they use anaerobic respiration instead. Certain bacteria can only use anaerobic respiration. In fact, they may not be able to survive at all in the presence of oxygen. An important way of making ATP without oxygen is called fermentation. It involves glycolysis, but not the other two stages of aerobic respiration. Many bacteria and yeasts carry out fermentation. People use these organisms to make yogurt, bread, wine, and biofuels. Human muscle cells also use fermentation. This occurs when muscle cells cannot get oxygen fast enough to meet their energy needs through aerobic respiration. There are two types of fermentation: lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation. Both types of fermentation are described below. You can also watch animations of both types at this link: URL 
Lactic  Acid  Fermentation 	  In lactic acid fermentation, pyruvic acid from glycolysis changes to lactic acid. This is shown in Figure 2.49. In the process, NAD+ forms from NADH. NAD+, in turn, lets glycolysis continue. This results in additional molecules of ATP. This type of fermentation is carried out by the bacteria in yogurt. It is also used by your own muscle cells when you work them hard and fast. Lactic acid fermentation produces lactic acid and NAD+. The NAD+ cycles back to allow glycolysis to continue so more ATP is made. Each circle represents a carbon atom. Did you ever run a race and notice that your muscles feel tired and sore afterward? This is because your muscle cells used lactic acid fermentation for energy. This causes lactic acid to build up in the muscles. It is the buildup of lactic acid that makes the muscles feel tired and sore. 
Alcoholic  Fermentation 	  In alcoholic fermentation, pyruvic acid changes to alcohol and carbon dioxide. This is shown in Figure 2.50. NAD+ also forms from NADH, allowing glycolysis to continue making ATP. This type of fermentation is carried out by yeasts and some bacteria. It is used to make bread, wine, and biofuels. Have your parents ever put corn in the gas tank of their car? They did if they used gas containing ethanol. Ethanol is produced by alcoholic fermentation of the glucose in corn or other plants. This type of fermentation also explains why bread dough rises. Yeasts in bread dough use alcoholic fermentation and produce carbon dioxide gas. The gas forms bubbles in the dough, which cause the dough to expand. The bubbles also leave small holes in the bread after it bakes, making the bread light and fluffy. Do you see the small holes in the slice of bread in Figure 2.51? 
Gut  Fermentation 	  Behind every fart is an army of gut bacteria undergoing some crazy biochemistry. These bacteria break down the remains of digested food through fermentation, creating gas in the process. Learn what these bacteria have in Alcoholic fermentation produces ethanol and NAD+.

Why oxygen? Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the electron transport chain of aerobic respiration. In the absence of oxygen, only a few ATP are produced from glucose. In the presence of oxygen, many more ATP are made. 
Aerobic vs.  Anaerobic  Respiration:  A  Comparison 	  Aerobic respiration, which takes place in the presence of oxygen, evolved after oxygen was added to Earth’s atmosphere. This type of respiration is useful today because the atmosphere is now 21% oxygen. However, some anaerobic organisms that evolved before the atmosphere contained oxygen have survived to the present. Therefore, anaerobic respiration, which takes place without oxygen, must also have advantages. 
Advantages of  Aerobic  Respiration 	  A major advantage of aerobic respiration is the amount of energy it releases. Without oxygen, organisms can split glucose into just two molecules of pyruvate. This releases only enough energy to make two ATP molecules. With oxygen, organisms can break down glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. This releases enough energy to produce up to 38 ATP molecules. Thus, aerobic respiration releases much more energy than anaerobic respiration. The amount of energy produced by aerobic respiration may explain why aerobic organisms came to dominate life on Earth. It may also explain how organisms were able to become multicellular and increase in size. 
Advantages of  Anaerobic  Respiration 	  One advantage of anaerobic respiration is obvious. It lets organisms live in places where there is little or no oxygen. Such places include deep water, soil, and the digestive tracts of animals such as humans (see Figure 2.52). 
E. coli bacteria are anaerobic bacteria 	  that live in the human digestive tract. Another advantage of anaerobic respiration is its speed. It produces ATP very quickly. For example, it lets your muscles get the energy they need for short bursts of intense activity (see Figure 2.53). Aerobic respiration, on the other hand, produces ATP more slowly. 
The muscles of these hurdlers need to 	  use anaerobic respiration for energy.

Where do cells come from? No matter what the cell, all cells come from preexisting cells through the process of cell division. The cell may be the simplest bacterium or a complex muscle, bone, or blood cell. The cell may comprise the whole organism, or be just one cell of trillions. 
Cell  Division 	  You consist of a great many cells, but like all other organisms, you started life as a single cell. How did you develop from a single cell into an organism with trillions of cells? The answer is cell division. After cells grow to their maximum size, they divide into two new cells. These new cells are small at first, but they grow quickly and eventually divide and produce more new cells. This process keeps repeating in a continuous cycle. Cell division is the process in which one cell, called the parent cell, divides to form two new cells, referred to as daughter cells. How this happens depends on whether the cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Cell division is simpler in prokaryotes than eukaryotes because prokaryotic cells themselves are simpler. Prokaryotic cells have a single circular chromosome, no nucleus, and few other organelles. Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have multiple chromosomes contained within a nucleus, and many other organelles. All of these cell parts must be duplicated and then separated when the cell divides. A chromosome is a molecule of DNA, and will be the focus of a subsequent concept. 
Cell  Division in  Prokaryotes 	  Most prokaryotic cells divide by the process of binary fission. A bacterial cell dividing this way is depicted in _fission_anim.gif . Binary fission can be described as a series of steps, although it is actually a continuous process. The steps are described below and also illustrated in Figure 2.55. They include DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and finally the separation into two daughter cells. 
Binary  Fission in a  Bacterial  Cell.  Cell 	  division is relatively simple in prokaryotic cells. The two cells are dividing by binary fission. Green and orange lines indicate old and newly-generated bacterial cell walls, respectively. Eventually the parent cell will pinch apart to form two identical daughter cells. Left, growth at the center of bacterial body. Right, apical growth from the ends of the bacterial body. • Step 1: DNA Replication. Just before the cell divides, its DNA is copied in a process called DNA replication. This results in two identical chromosomes instead of just one. This step is necessary so that when the cell divides, each daughter cell will have its own chromosome. • Step 2: Chromosome Segregation. The two chromosomes segregate, or separate, and move to opposite ends (known as "poles") of the cell. This occurs as each copy of DNA attaches to different parts of the cell membrane. • Step 3: Separation. A new plasma membrane starts growing into the center of the cell, and the cytoplasm splits apart, forming two daughter cells. As the cell begins to pull apart, the new and the original chromosomes are separated. The two daughter cells that result are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell. New cell wall must also form around the two cells. 
Cell  Division in  Eukaryotes 	  Cell division is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes. Prior to dividing, all the DNA in a eukaryotic cell’s multiple chromosomes is replicated. Its organelles are also duplicated. Then, when the cell divides, it occurs in two major steps: the nuclear membrane breaks down and later reforms. The chromosomes are also sorted and separated to ensure that each daughter cell receives a diploid number (2 sets) of chromosomes. In humans, that number of chromosomes is 46 (23 pairs). Mitosis is described in greater detail in a subsequent concept. division of the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells. 
Summary 	  • Cell division is part of the life cycle of virtually all cells. Cell division is the process in which one cell divides to form two new cells. • Most prokaryotic cells divide by the process of binary fission. • In eukaryotes, cell division occurs in two major steps: mitosis and cytokinesis.

What is a cell’s life like? The eukaryotic cell spends most of its "life" in interphase of the cell cycle, which can be subdivided into the three phases, G1, S and G2. During interphase, the cell does what it is supposed to do. Though cells have many common functions, such as DNA replication, they also have certain specific functions. That is, during the life of a heart cell, the cell would obviously perform certain different activities than a kidney cell or a liver cell. 
The  Cell  Cycle 	  Cell division is just one of several stages that a cell goes through during its lifetime. The cell cycle is a repeating series of events that include growth, DNA synthesis, and cell division. The cell cycle in prokaryotes is quite simple: the cell grows, its DNA replicates, and the cell divides. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle is more complicated. 
The  Eukaryotic  Cell  Cycle 	  The diagram in Figure 2.56 represents the cell cycle of a eukaryotic cell. As you can see, the eukaryotic cell cycle has several phases. The mitotic phase (M) actually includes both mitosis and cytokinesis. This is when the nucleus and then the cytoplasm divide. The other three phases (G1, S, and G2) are generally grouped together as interphase. During interphase, the cell grows, performs routine life processes, and prepares to divide. These phases are discussed below. You can watch a eukaryotic cell going through these phases of the cell cycle at the following link: URL ww.cellsalive.com/cell_cycle.htm . Eukaryotic Cell Cycle. This diagram represents the cell cycle in eukaryotes. The 
First  Gap,  Synthesis, and  Second  Gap 	  phases make up interphase (I). The M (mitotic) phase includes mitosis and cytokinesis. After the M phase, two cells result. 
Interphase 	  Interphase of the eukaryotic cell cycle can be subdivided into the following three phases, which are represented in • Growth Phase 1 (G1): during this phase, the cell grows rapidly, while performing routine metabolic processes. It also makes proteins needed for DNA replication and copies some of its organelles in preparation for cell division. A cell typically spends most of its life in this phase. This phase is sometimes referred to as Gap • Synthesis Phase (S): during this phase, the cell’s DNA is copied in the process of DNA replication. • Growth Phase 2 (G2): during this phase, the cell makes final preparations to divide. For example, it makes additional proteins and organelles. This phase is sometimes referred to as Gap 2. 
Control of the  Cell  Cycle 	  If the cell cycle occurred without regulation, cells might go from one phase to the next before they were ready. What controls the cell cycle? How does the cell know when to grow, synthesize DNA, and divide? The cell cycle is controlled mainly by regulatory proteins. These proteins control the cycle by signaling the cell to either start or delay the next phase of the cycle. They ensure that the cell completes the previous phase before moving on. Regulatory proteins control the cell cycle at key checkpoints, which are shown in Figure 2.57. There are a number of main checkpoints. • The G1 checkpoint, just before entry into S phase, makes the key decision of whether the cell should divide. • The S checkpoint determines if the DNA has been replicated properly. • The mitotic spindle checkpoint occurs at the point in metaphase where all the chromosomes should have aligned at the mitotic plate. 
Checkpoints in the eukaryotic cell cycle 	  ensure that the cell is ready to proceed before it moves on to the next phase of the cycle. 
Cancer and the  Cell  Cycle 	  Cancer is a disease that occurs when the cell cycle is no longer regulated. This may happen because a cell’s DNA becomes damaged. Damage can occur due to exposure to hazards such as radiation or toxic chemicals. Cancerous cells generally divide much faster than normal cells. They may form a mass of abnormal cells called a tumor (see and organs and eventually lead to death. Cancer is discussed in the video at URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • The cell cycle is a repeating series of events that cells go through. It includes growth, DNA synthesis, and cell division. In eukaryotic cells, there are two growth phases, and cell division includes mitosis. • The cell cycle is controlled by regulatory proteins at three key checkpoints in the cycle. The proteins signal the cell to either start or delay the next phase of the cycle. 
These cells are cancer cells, growing out 	  of control and forming a tumor. • Cancer is a disease that occurs when the cell cycle is no longer regulated.

How is it assured that every cell in your body has the same DNA? Chromosomes, like those shown here, must form prior to cell division, to ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete set of genetic material. Essentially, each new cell receives half of each "X-shaped" chromosome. 
Chromosomes 	  In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus divides before the cell itself divides. The process in which the nucleus divides is called mitosis. Before mitosis occurs, a cell’s DNA is replicated. This is necessary so that each daughter cell will have a complete copy of the genetic material from the parent cell. How is the replicated DNA sorted and separated so that each daughter cell gets a complete set of the genetic material? To understand how this happens, you need to know more about chromosomes. Chromosomes are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins. Chromosomes are the form of the genetic material of a cell during cell division. It is this coiled structure that ensures proper segregation of the chromosomes during cell division. During other phases of the cell cycle, DNA is not coiled into chromosomes. Instead, it exists as a grainy material called chromatin. The vocabulary of DNA: chromosomes, chromatids, chromatin, transcription, translation, and replication is discussed at URL (18:23). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Chromatids and the  Centromere 	  DNA condenses and coils into the familiar X-shaped form of a chromosome, shown in Figure 2.59, only after it has replicated. (You can watch DNA coiling into a chromosome at the link below.) Because DNA has already replicated, each chromosome actually consists of two identical copies. The two copies are called sister chromatids. They are attached to one another at a region called the centromere. A remarkable animation can be viewed at URL hmi.org/biointeractive/media/DNAi_packaging_vo2-sm.mov . Chromosome. After DNA replicates, it forms chromosomes like the one shown here. 
Chromosomes and  Genes 	  The DNA of a chromosome is encoded with genetic instructions for making proteins. These instructions are organized into units called genes. Most genes contain the instructions for a single protein. There may be hundreds or even thousands of genes on a single chromosome. 
Human  Chromosomes 	  Human cells normally have two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent. There are 23 chromosomes in each set, for a total of 46 chromosomes per cell. Each chromosome in one set is matched by a chromosome of the same type in the other set, so there are actually 23 pairs of chromosomes per cell. Each pair consists of chromosomes of the same size and shape that also contain the same genes. The chromosomes in a pair are known as homologous chromosomes. 
Summary 	  • Chromosomes are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins. • Chromosomes form after DNA replicates; prior to replication, DNA exists as chromatin. • Chromosomes contain genes, which code for proteins. • Human cells normally have 46 chromosomes, made up of two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent. • See Chromosomes at URL for a detailed summary.

What is meant by the "division of the nucleus"? What do you think this colorful picture shows? If you guessed that it’s a picture of a cell undergoing cell division, you are right. But more specifically, the image is a lung cell stained with fluorescent dyes undergoing mitosis, during early anaphase. 
Mitosis and  Cytokinesis 	  During mitosis, when the nucleus divides, the two chromatids that make up each chromosome separate from each other and move to opposite poles of the cell. This is shown in Figure 2.60. You can watch an animation of the process at the following link: URL . Mitosis actually occurs in four phases. The phases are called prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. They are shown in Figure 2.61 and described in greater detail in the following sections. 
Mitosis is the phase of the eukaryotic cell 	  cycle that occurs between DNA replication and the formation of two daughter cells. What happens during mitosis? 
Prophase 	  The first and longest phase of mitosis is prophase. During prophase, chromatin condenses into chromosomes, and the nuclear envelope, or membrane, breaks down. In animal cells, the centrioles near the nucleus begin to separate and move to opposite poles (sides) of the cell. As the centrioles move, a spindle starts to form between them. The spindle, shown in Figure 2.62, consists of fibers made of microtubules. 
Metaphase 	  During metaphase, spindle fibers attach to the centromere of each pair of sister chromatids (see Figure 2.63). The sister chromatids line up at the equator, or center, of the cell. This is also known as the metaphase plate. The spindle fibers ensure that sister chromatids will separate and go to different daughter cells when the cell divides. 
Anaphase 	  During anaphase, sister chromatids separate and the centromeres divide. The sister chromatids are pulled apart by the shortening of the spindle fibers. This is like reeling in a fish by shortening the fishing line. One sister chromatid moves to one pole of the cell, and the other sister chromatid moves to the opposite pole. At the end of anaphase, each pole of the cell has a complete set of chromosomes. 
Telophase 	  During telophase, the chromosomes begin to uncoil and form chromatin. This prepares the genetic material for directing the metabolic activities of the new cells. The spindle also breaks down, and new nuclear membranes (nuclear envelope) form. Mitosis in the Eukaryotic Cell Cycle. Mitosis is the multi-phase process in which the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell divides. 
Cytokinesis 	  Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division in eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes. During cytokinesis, the cytoplasm splits in two and the cell divides. Cytokinesis occurs somewhat differently in plant and animal cells, as shown in two daughter cells form. In plant cells, a cell plate forms along the equator of the parent cell. Then, a new plasma membrane and cell wall form along each side of the cell plate. The phases of mitosis are discussed in the video: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Spindle.  The spindle starts to form during 	  prophase of mitosis. Kinetochores on the spindle attach to the centromeres of sister chromatids. Chromosomes, consisting of sister chromatids, line up at the equator or middle of the cell during metaphase.

One parent or two? That is the main difference between sexual and asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction just means combining genetic material from two parents. Asexual reproduction produces offspring genetically identical to the one parent. 
Reproduction:  Asexual vs.  Sexual 	  Cell division is how organisms grow and repair themselves. It is also how many organisms produce offspring. For many single-celled organisms, reproduction is a similar process. The parent cell simply divides to form two daughter cells that are identical to the parent. In many other organisms, two parents are involved, and the offspring are not identical to the parents. In fact, each offspring is unique. Look at the family in Figure 2.66. The children resemble their parents, but they are not identical to them. Instead, each has a unique combination of characteristics inherited from both parents. Reproduction is the process by which organisms give rise to offspring. It is one of the defining characteristics of living things. There are two basic types of reproduction: asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction. Family Portrait: Mother, Daughter, Father, and Son. Children resemble their parents, but they are never identical to them. Do you know why this is the case? 
Asexual  Reproduction 	  Asexual reproduction involves a single parent. It results in offspring that are genetically identical to each other and to the parent. All prokaryotes and some eukaryotes reproduce this way. There are several different methods of asexual reproduction. They include binary fission, fragmentation, and budding. • Binary fission occurs when a parent cell splits into two identical daughter cells of the same size. • Fragmentation occurs when a parent organism breaks into fragments, or pieces, and each fragment develops into a new organism. Starfish, like the one in Figure 2.68, reproduce this way. A new starfish can develop from a single ray, or arm. Starfish, however, are also capable of sexual reproduction. • Budding occurs when a parent cell forms a bubble-like bud. The bud stays attached to the parent cell while it grows and develops. When the bud is fully developed, it breaks away from the parent cell and forms a new organism. Budding in yeast is shown in Figure 2.68. Asexual reproduction can be very rapid. This is an advantage for many organisms. It allows them to crowd out other organisms that reproduce more slowly. Bacteria, for example, may divide several times per hour. Under ideal conditions, 100 bacteria can divide to produce millions of bacterial cells in just a few hours! However, most bacteria do not live under ideal conditions. If they did, the entire surface of the planet would soon be covered with them. Instead, their reproduction is kept in check by limited resources, predators, and their own wastes. This is true of most other organisms as well. 
Sexual  Reproduction 	  Sexual reproduction involves two parents. As you can see from Figure 2.69, in sexual reproduction, parents produce reproductive cells—called gametes—that unite to form an offspring. Gametes are haploid cells. This means they contain only half the number of chromosomes found in other cells of the organism. Gametes are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis, which is described in detail in a subsequent concept. The process in which two gametes unite is called fertilization. The fertilized cell that results is referred to as a zygote. A zygote is diploid cell, which means that it has twice the number of chromosomes as a gamete. Binary Fission in various single-celled organisms (left). Cell division is a relatively simple process in many single-celled organisms. Eventually the parent cell will pinch apart to form two identical daughter cells. In multiple fission (right), a multinucleated cell can divide to form more than one daughter cell. Multiple fission is more often observed among protists. Mitosis, Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction is discussed at URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • Asexual reproduction involves one parent and produces offspring that are genetically identical to each other and to the parent. • Sexual reproduction involves two parents and produces offspring that are genetically unique. Starfish reproduce by fragmentation and yeasts reproduce by budding. Both are types of asexual reproduction. 
Cycle of  Sexual  Reproduction.  Sexual 	  reproduction involves the production of haploid gametes by meiosis. This is followed by fertilization and the formation of a diploid zygote. The number of chromosomes in a gamete is represented by the letter n. Why does the zygote have 2n, or twice as many, chromosomes? • During sexual reproduction, two haploid gametes join in the process of fertilization to produce a diploid zygote. • Meiosis is the type of cell division that produces gametes.

How do you make a cell with half the DNA? Meiosis. This allows cells to have half the number of chromosomes, so two of these cells can come back together to form a new organism with the complete number of chromosomes. This process not only helps produce gametes, it also ensures genetic variation. 
Meiosis 	  The process that produces haploid gametes is meiosis. Meiosis is a type of cell division in which the number of chromosomes is reduced by half. It occurs only in certain special cells of the organisms. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate, and haploid cells form that have only one chromosome from each pair. Two cell divisions occur during meiosis, and a total of four haploid cells are produced. The two cell divisions are called meiosis I and meiosis II. The overall process of meiosis is summarized in Figure 2.70. You can watch an animation of meiosis at this link: URL . 
Phases of  Meiosis 	  Meiosis I begins after DNA replicates during interphase of the cell cycle. In both meiosis I and meiosis II, cells go through the same four phases as mitosis prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. However, there are Overview of Meiosis. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate and go to different daughter cells. This diagram shows just the nuclei of the cells.

The flowchart in Figure 2.71 shows what happens in both meiosis I and II. Compare meiosis I in this flowchart with the figure from the Mitosis and Cytokinesis concept. How does meiosis I differ from mitosis? Notice at the beginning of meiosis (prophase I), homologous chromosomes exchange segments of DNA. This is known as crossing-over, and is unique to this phase of meiosis. The phases of meiosis are discussed at URL (27:23). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Meiosis  	  moving to opposite poles of the cell, and a spindle begins to form. Importantly, homologous chromosomes pair up, which is unique to prophase I.

In metaphase of mitosis and meiosis II, it is sister chromatids that line up along the equator of the cell. other.

What’s the biggest cell on Earth? The ostrich egg unfertilized, of course. Yes, this egg, just like a human ovum, is just one cell. The egg shell membrane encloses the nucleus containing the genetic material and the cytoplasm. 
Gametogenesis 	  At the end of meiosis, four haploid cells have been produced, but the cells are not yet gametes. The cells need to develop before they become mature gametes capable of fertilization. The development of haploid cells into gametes is called gametogenesis. Gametogenesis may differ between males and females. Male gametes are called sperm. Female gametes are called eggs. In human males, for example, the process that produces mature sperm cells is called spermatogenesis. During this process, sperm cells grow a tail and gain the ability to “swim,” like the human sperm cell shown in Figure 2.73. In human females, the process that produces mature eggs is called oogenesis. Just one egg is produced from the

A as a body cell.  Notice the three 	  distinct segments: a head piece, a flagella tail and a midpiece of mostly mitochondria. What is the role of each section? four haploid cells that result from meiosis. The single egg is a very large cell, as you can see from the human egg in A human sperm is a tiny cell with a tail. A human egg is much larger. Both cells are mature haploid gametes that are capable of fertilization. What process is shown in this photograph? Notice the sperm with the head piece containing the genetic material, a flagella tail that propels the sperm, and a midpiece of mostly mitochondria, supplying ATP. 
Spermatogenesis and  Oogenesis 	  During spermatogenesis, primary spermatocytes go through the first cell division of meiosis to produce secondary spermatocytes. These are haploid cells. Secondary spermatocytes then quickly complete the meiotic division to become spermatids, which are also haploid cells. The four haploid cells produced from meiosis develop a flagellum tail and compact head piece to become mature sperm cells, capable of swimming and fertilizing an egg. The compact head, which has lost most of its cytoplasm, is key in the formation of a streamlined shape. The middle piece of the sperm, connecting the head to the tail, contains many mitochondria, providing energy to the cell. The sperm cell essentially contributes only DNA to the zygote. On the other hand, the egg provides the other half of the DNA, but also organelles, building blocks for compounds such as proteins and nucleic acids, and other necessary materials. The egg, being much larger than a sperm cell, contains almost all of the cytoplasm a developing embryo will have during its first few days of life. Therefore, oogenesis is a much more complicated process than spermatogenesis. Oogenesis begins before birth and is not completed until after fertilization. Oogenesis begins when oogonia (singular, oogonium), which are the immature eggs that form in the ovaries before birth and have the diploid number of chromosomes, undergo mitosis to form primary oocytes, also with the diploid number. Oogenesis proceeds as a primary oocyte undergoes the first cell division of meiosis to form secondary oocytes with the haploid number of chromosomes. A secondary oocyte only undergoes the second meiotic cell division to form a haploid ovum if it is fertilized by a sperm. The one egg cell that results from meiosis contains most of the cytoplasm, nutrients, and organelles. This unequal distribution of materials produces one large cell, and one cell with little more than DNA. This other cell, known as a polar body, eventually breaks down. The larger cell undergoes meiosis II, once again producing a large cell and a polar body. The large cell develops into the mature gamete, called an ovum ( from fertilization receives all of its cytoplasm from the egg. So the egg needs to have as much cytoplasm as possible. Maturation of the ovum. Notice only one mature ovum, or egg, forms during meiosis from the primary oocyte. Three polar bodies may form during oogenesis. These polar bodies will not form mature gametes.

What helps ensure the survival of a species? Genetic variation. It is this variation that is the essence of evolution. Without genetic differences among individuals, "survival of the fittest" would not be likely. Either all survive, or all perish. 
Genetic  Variation 	  Sexual reproduction results in infinite possibilities of genetic variation. In other words, sexual reproduction results in offspring that are genetically unique. They differ from both parents and also from each other. This occurs for a number of reasons. • When homologous chromosomes form pairs during prophase I of meiosis I, crossing-over can occur. Crossingover is the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. It results in new combinations of genes on each chromosome. • When cells divide during meiosis, homologous chromosomes are randomly distributed to daughter cells, and different chromosomes segregate independently of each other. This called is called independent assortment. It results in gametes that have unique combinations of chromosomes. • In sexual reproduction, two gametes unite to produce an offspring. But which two of the millions of possible gametes will it be? This is likely to be a matter of chance. It is obviously another source of genetic variation in offspring. This is known as random fertilization. All of these mechanisms working together result in an amazing amount of potential variation. Each human couple, for example, has the potential to produce more than 64 trillion genetically unique children. No wonder we are all different! See Sources of Variation at URL for additional information. 
Crossing- Over 	  Crossing-over occurs during prophase I, and it is the exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. Recall during prophase I, homologous chromosomes line up in pairs, gene-forgene down their entire length, forming a configuration with four chromatids, known as a tetrad. At this point, the chromatids are very close to each other and some material from two chromatids switch chromosomes, that is, the material breaks off and reattaches at the same position on the homologous chromosome ( Figure 2.75). This exchange of genetic material can happen many times within the same pair of homologous chromosomes, creating unique combinations of genes. This process is also known as recombination. 
Crossing-over.  A maternal strand of  	  is shown in red. A paternal strand of 
A is shown in blue.  Crossing over 	  produces two chromosomes that have not previously existed. The process of recombination involves the breakage and rejoining of parental chromosomes (M, F). 
This results in the generation of novel 	  chromosomes (C1, C2) that share DNA from both parents. 
Independent  Assortment and  Random  Fertilization 	  In humans, there are over 8 million configurations in which the chromosomes can line up during metaphase I of meiosis. It is the specific processes of meiosis, resulting in four unique haploid cells, that result in these many combinations. This independent assortment, in which the chromosome inherited from either the father or mother can sort into any gamete, produces the potential for tremendous genetic variation. Together with random fertilization, more possibilities for genetic variation exist between any two people than the number of individuals alive today. Sexual reproduction is the random fertilization of a gamete from the female using a gamete from the male. In humans, over 8 million (223) chromosome combinations exist in the production of gametes in both the male and female. A sperm cell, with over 8 million chromosome combinations, fertilizes an egg cell, which also has over 8 million chromosome combinations. That is over 64 trillion unique combinations, not counting the unique combinations produced by crossing-over. In other words, each human couple could produce a child with over 64 trillion unique chromosome combinations! See How Cells Divide: Mitosis vs. Meiosis at URL for an animation comparing the two processes.

Life  Cycles 	  Sexual reproduction occurs in a cycle. Diploid parents produce haploid gametes that unite and develop into diploid adults, which repeat the cycle. This series of life stages and events that a sexually reproducing organism goes through is called its life cycle. Sexually reproducing organisms can have different types of life cycles. Three are represented in Figure 2.76 and described following sections. 
Haploid  Life  Cycle 	  The haploid life cycle is the simplest life cycle. It is found in many single-celled eukaryotic organisms. Organisms with a haploid life cycle spend the majority of their lives as haploid gametes. When the haploid gametes fuse, they form a diploid zygote. It quickly undergoes meiosis to produce more haploid gametes that repeat the life cycle. 
Diploid  Life  Cycle 	  Organisms with a diploid life cycle spend the majority of their lives as diploid adults. When they are ready to reproduce, they undergo meiosis and produce haploid gametes. Gametes then unite in fertilization and form a Life cycles can vary in sexually reproducing organisms. Three types of sexual life cycles are shown here. Do you see how they differ? The letter n indicates haploid stages of the life cycles, and 2n indicates diploid stages. diploid zygote, which immediately enters G1 of the cell cycle. Next, the zygote’s DNA is replicated. Finally, the processes of mitosis and cytokinesis produce two genetically identical diploid cells. Through repeated rounds of growth and division, this organism becomes a diploid adult and the cycle continues. Can you think of an organism with a diploid life cycle? (Hint: What type of life cycle do humans have?) 
Alternation of  Generations 	  Plants, algae, and some protists have a life cycle that alternates between diploid and haploid phases, known as alternation of generations. In plants, the life cycle alternates between the diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte. Spore forming cells in the diploid sporophyte undergo meiosis to produce spores, a haploid reproductive cell. Spores can develop into an adult without fusing with another cell. The spores give rise to a multicellular haploid gametophyte, which produce gametes by mitosis. The gametes fuse, producing a diploid zygote, which grow into the diploid sporophyte. These life cycles may be quite complicated. You can read about them in additional concepts.

Summary 	  The cell is the smallest unit of structure and function of all living organisms. Cell Biology focuses on significant aspects of the cell from its structure to its division. Some organisms contain just one cell, and others contain trillions. Some have a nucleus with DNA, others do not. Some have many organelles, others do not. But all cells are surrounded by a cell membrane. And it is this semipermeable membrane that determines what can enter and leave the cell. All cells need energy, and for many organisms, this energy comes from photosynthesis and cellular respiration. All cells come from preexisting cells through the process of cell division, which can produce a new prokaryotic organism. The cell cycle, which includes mitosis, defines the life of an eukaryotic cell. when he looked at a slice of cork under his microscope .

Introduction 	  Why is heredity so important? Genetics the study of inheritance. Inheritance the passing of traits from parents to offspring. How are these traits "passed"? Through DNA the genetic material. The Genetics chapter will focus on genetics, inheritance, and DNA. • Define genetics. • Describe the importance of Gregor Mendel. • Explain why Mendel studied pea plants. • Distinguish self-pollination from cross-pollination. What’s so interesting about pea plants? These purple-flowered plants are not just pretty to look at. Plants like these led to a huge leap forward in biology. The plants are common garden pea plants, and they were studied in the mid-1800s by an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel. With his careful experiments, Mendel uncovered the secrets of heredity, or how parents pass characteristics to their offspring. You may not care much about heredity in pea plants, but you probably care about your own heredity. Mendel’s discoveries apply to you as well as to peas—and to all other living things that reproduce sexually. 
Mendel and  His  Pea  Plants 	  People have long known that the characteristics of living things are similar in parents and their offspring. Whether it’s the flower color in pea plants or nose shape in people, it is obvious that offspring resemble their parents. However, it wasn’t until the experiments of Gregor Mendel that scientists understood how characteristics are inherited. Mendel’s discoveries formed the basis of genetics, the science of heredity. That’s why Mendel is often called the "father of genetics." It’s not common for a single researcher to have such an important impact on science. The importance of Mendel’s work was due to three things: a curious mind, sound scientific methods, and good luck. You’ll see why when you read about Mendel’s experiments. An introduction to heredity can be seen at URL (17:27). Click image to the left or use the URL below. Gregor Mendel was born in 1822 and grew up on his parents’ farm in Austria. He did well in school and became a monk. He also went to the University of Vienna, where he studied science and math. His professors encouraged him to learn science through experimentation and to use math to make sense of his results. Mendel is best known for his experiments with the pea plant Pisum sativum (see Figure 3.1). You can watch a video about Mendel and his research at the following link: URL . 
Gregor  Mendel.  The  Austrian monk  Gregor  Mendel experimented with 	  pea plants. He did all of his research in the garden of the monastery where he lived. 
Blending  Theory of  Inheritance 	  During Mendel’s time, the blending theory of inheritance was popular. This is the theory that offspring have a blend, or mix, of the characteristics of their parents. Mendel noticed plants in his own garden that weren’t a blend of the parents. For example, a tall plant and a short plant had offspring that were either tall or short but not medium in height. Observations such as these led Mendel to question the blending theory. He wondered if there was a different underlying principle that could explain how characteristics are inherited. He decided to experiment with pea plants to find out. In fact, Mendel experimented with almost 30,000 pea plants over the next several years! At the following link, you can watch an animation in which Mendel explains how he arrived at his decision to study inheritance in pea plants: URL . Why Study Pea Plants? Why did Mendel choose common, garden-variety pea plants for his experiments? Pea plants are a good choice because they are fast growing and easy to raise. They also have several visible characteristics that may vary. These characteristics, which are shown in Figure 3.2, include seed form and color, flower color, pod form and color, placement of pods and flowers on stems, and stem length. Each characteristic has two common values. For example, seed form may be round or wrinkled, and flower color may be white or purple (violet). Mendel investigated seven different characteristics in pea plants. In this chart, cotyledons refer to the tiny leaves inside seeds. Axial pods are located along the stems. Terminal pods are located at the ends of the stems. 
Controlling  Pollination 	  To research how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring, Mendel needed to control pollination. Pollination is the fertilization step in the sexual reproduction of plants. Pollen consists of tiny grains that are the male gametes of plants. They are produced by a male flower part called the anther (see Figure 3.3). Pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from the anther to the stigma of the same or another flower. The stigma is a female part of a flower. It passes the pollen grains to female gametes in the ovary. 
Flowers are the reproductive organs of 	  plants. Each pea plant flower has both male and female parts. The anther is part of the stamen, the male structure that produces male gametes (pollen). The stigma is part of the female structure that produces female gametes and guides the pollen grains to them. 
The stigma receives the pollen grains and 	  passes them to the ovary, which contains female gametes. the pistil, Pea plants are naturally self-pollinating. In self-pollination, pollen grains from anthers on one plant are transferred to stigmas of flowers on the same plant. Mendel was interested in the offspring of two different parent plants, so he had to prevent self-pollination. He removed the anthers from the flowers of some of the plants in his experiments. Then he pollinated them by hand with pollen from other parent plants of his choice. When pollen from one plant fertilizes another plant of the same species, it is called cross-pollination. The offspring that result from such a cross are called hybrids. 
Summary 	  • Gregor Mendel experimented with pea plants to learn how characteristics are passed from parents to offspring. • Mendel’s discoveries formed the basis of genetics, the science of heredity. • Cross-pollination produces hybrids.

Peas. Some round and some wrinkled. Why? That’s what Mendel asked. He noticed peas were always round or wrinkled, but never anything else. Seed shape was one of the traits Mendel studied in his first set of experiments. 
Mendel’s  First  Set of  Experiments 	  Mendel first experimented with just one characteristic of a pea plant at a time. He began with flower color. As shown in Figure 3.4, Mendel cross-pollinated purpleand white-flowered parent plants. The parent plants in the experiments are referred to as the P (for parent) generation. You can explore an interactive animation of Mendel’s first set of experiments at this link: URL . 
F1 and  F2  Generations 	  The offspring of the P generation are called the F1 (for filial, or “offspring”) generation. As you can see from wondered what had happened to the white-flower characteristic. He assumed some type of inherited factor produces white flowers and some other inherited factor produces purple flowers. Did the white-flower factor just disappear in the F1 generation? If so, then the offspring of the F1 generation—called the F2 generation—should all have purple flowers like their parents. This diagram shows Mendel’s first experiment with pea plants. The F1 generation results from cross-pollination of two parent (P) plants, and contained all purple flowers. The F2 generation results from self-pollination of F1 plants, and contained 75% purple flowers and 25% white flowers. This type of experiment is known as a monohybrid cross. To test this prediction, Mendel allowed the F1 generation plants to self-pollinate. He was surprised by the results. Some of the F2 generation plants had white flowers. He studied hundreds of F2 generation plants, and for every three purple-flowered plants, there was an average of one white-flowered plant. 
Law of  Segregation 	  Mendel did the same experiment for all seven characteristics. In each case, one value of the characteristic disappeared in the F1 plants and then showed up again in the F2 plants. And in each case, 75 percent of F2 plants had one value of the characteristic and 25 percent had the other value. Based on these observations, Mendel formulated his first law of inheritance. This law is called the law of segregation. It states that there are two factors controlling a given characteristic, one of which dominates the other, and these factors separate and go to different gametes when a parent reproduces. 
Summary 	  • Mendel first researched one characteristic at a time. This led to his law of segregation. This law states that each characteristic is controlled by two factors, which separate and go to different gametes when an organism reproduces.

Then, you let the offspring selfpollinate.

Round and green, round and yellow, wrinkled and green, or wrinkled and yellow? Can two traits be inherited together? Or are all traits inherited separately? Mendel asked these questions after his first round of experiments. 
Mendel’s  Second  Set of  Experiments 	  After observing the results of his first set of experiments, Mendel wondered whether different characteristics are inherited together. For example, are purple flowers and tall stems always inherited together? Or do these two characteristics show up in different combinations in offspring? To answer these questions, Mendel next investigated two characteristics at a time. For example, he crossed plants with yellow round seeds and plants with green wrinkled seeds. The results of this cross, which is a dihybrid cross, are shown in Figure 3.5. 
F1 and  F2  Generations 	  In this set of experiments, Mendel observed that plants in the F1 generation were all alike. All of them had yellow and round seeds like one of the two parents. When the F1 generation plants self-pollinated, however, their offspring—the F2 generation—showed all possible combinations of the two characteristics. Some had green round seeds, for example, and some had yellow wrinkled seeds. These combinations of characteristics were not present in the F1 or P generations. 
This chart represents  Mendel’s second 	  set of experiments. It shows the outcome of a cross between plants that differ in seed color (yellow or green) and seed form (shown here with a smooth round appearance or wrinkled appearance). The letters R, r, Y, and y represent genes for the characteristics Mendel was studying. Mendel didn’t know about genes, however. Genes would not be discovered until several decades later. This experiment demonstrates that in the F2 generation, wrinkled yellow seeds, 3/16 were round green seeds, and 1/16 were wrinkled green seeds. 
Law of  Independent  Assortment 	  Mendel repeated this experiment with other combinations of characteristics, such as flower color and stem length. Each time, the results were the same as those in Figure 3.5. The results of Mendel’s second set of experiments led to his second law. This is the law of independent assortment. It states that factors controlling different characteristics are inherited independently of each other. 
Summary 	  • After his first set of experiments, Mendel researched two characteristics at a time. This led to his law of independent assortment. This law states that the factors controlling different characteristics are inherited independently of each other.

Mendel’s  Laws and  Genetics 	  You might think that Mendel’s discoveries would have made a big impact on science as soon as he made them. But you would be wrong. Why? Because Mendel’s work was largely ignored. Mendel was far ahead of his time and working from a remote monastery. He had no reputation among the scientific community and no previously published work. Mendel’s work, titled Experiments in Plant Hybridization, was published in 1866, and sent to prominent libraries in several countries, as well as 133 natural science associations. Mendel himself even sent carefully marked experiment kits to Karl von Nageli, the leading botanist of the day. The result it was almost completely ignored. Von Nageli instead sent hawkweed seeds to Mendel, which he thought was a better plant for studying heredity. Unfortunately hawkweed reproduces asexually, resulting in genetically identical clones of the parent. Charles Darwin published his landmark book on evolution in 1869, not long after Mendel had discovered his laws. Unfortunately, Darwin knew nothing of Mendel’s discoveries and didn’t understand heredity. This made his arguments about evolution less convincing to many people. This example demonstrates the importance for scientists to communicate the results of their investigations. 
Rediscovering  Mendel’s  Work 	  Mendel’s work was virtually unknown until 1900. In that year, three different European scientists —named Hugo De Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich Von Tschermak-Seysenegg —independently arrived at Mendel’s laws. All three had done experiments similar to Mendel’s. They came to the same conclusions that he had drawn almost half a century earlier. Only then was Mendel’s actual work rediscovered. As scientists learned more about heredity the passing of traits from parents to offspring over the next few decades, they were able to describe Mendel’s ideas about inheritance in terms of genes. In this way, the field of genetics was born. At the link that follows, you can watch an animation of Mendel explaining his laws of inheritance in genetic terms. URL 
Genetics of  Inheritance 	  Today, we known that characteristics of organisms are controlled by genes on chromosomes (see Figure 3.6). The position of a gene on a chromosome is called its locus. In sexually reproducing organisms, each individual has two copies of the same gene, as there are two versions of the same chromosome ( homologous chromosomes). One copy comes from each parent. The gene for a characteristic may have different versions, but the different versions are always at the same locus. The different versions are called alleles. For example, in pea plants, there is a purple-flower allele (B) and a white-flower allele (b). Different alleles account for much of the variation in the characteristics of organisms. Chromosome, Gene, Locus, and Allele. This diagram shows how the concepts of chromosome, gene, locus, and allele are related. What is the different between a gene and a locus? Between a gene and an allele? During meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate and go to different gametes. Thus, the two alleles for each gene also go to different gametes. At the same time, different chromosomes assort independently. As a result, alleles for different genes assort independently as well. In these ways, alleles are shuffled and recombined in each parent’s gametes. 
Genotype and  Phenotype 	  When gametes unite during fertilization, the resulting zygote inherits two alleles for each gene. One allele comes from each parent. The alleles an individual inherits make up the individual’s genotype. The two alleles may be the same or different. As shown in Table 3.1, an organism with two alleles of the same type (BB or bb) is called a homozygote. An organism with two different alleles (Bb) is called a heterozygote. This results in three possible genotypes. 
Alleles 	  B (purple) b (white) 
Genotypes 	  BB (homozygote) Bb (heterozygote) bb (homozygote) 
Phenotypes 	  purple flowers purple flowers white flowers The expression of an organism’s genotype produces its phenotype. The phenotype refers to the organism’s characteristics, such as purple or white flowers. As you can see from Table 3.1, different genotypes may produce the same phenotype. For example, BB and Bb genotypes both produce plants with purple flowers. Why does this happen? In a Bb heterozygote, only the B allele is expressed, so the b allele doesn’t influence the phenotype. In general, when only one of two alleles is expressed in the phenotype, the expressed allele is called the dominant allele. The allele that isn’t expressed is called the recessive allele. 
How  Mendel  Worked  Backward to  Get  Ahead 	  Mendel used hundreds or even thousands of pea plants in each experiment he did. Therefore, his results were very close to those you would expect based on the rules of probability (see "Probability and Inheritance" concept). For example, in one of his first experiments with flower color, there were 929 plants in the F2 generation. Of these, 705 (76 percent) had purple flowers and 224 (24 percent) had white flowers. Thus, Mendel’s results were very close to the 75 percent purple and 25 percent white you would expect by the laws of probability for this type of cross. Of course, Mendel had only phenotypes to work with. He knew nothing about genes and genotypes. Instead, he had to work backward from phenotypes and their percents in offspring to understand inheritance. From the results of his first set of experiments, Mendel realized that there must be two factors controlling each of the characteristics he studied, with one of the factors being dominant to the other. He also realized that the two factors separate and go to different gametes and later recombine in the offspring. This is an example of Mendel’s good luck. All of the characteristics he studied happened to be inherited in this way. Mendel also was lucky when he did his second set of experiments. He happened to pick characteristics that are inherited independently of one another. We now know that these characteristics are controlled by genes on nonhomologous chromosomes. What if Mendel had studied characteristics controlled by genes on homologous chromosomes? Would they be inherited together? If so, how do you think this would have affected Mendel’s conclusions? Would he have been able to develop his second law of inheritance? To better understand how Mendel interpreted his findings and developed his laws of inheritance, you can visit the following link. It provides an animation in which Mendel explains how he came to understand heredity from his experimental results. URL 
Summary 	  • Mendel’s work was rediscovered in 1900. Soon after that, genes and alleles were discovered. This allowed Mendel’s laws to be stated in terms of the inheritance of alleles. • The gene for a characteristic may have different versions. These different versions of a gene are known as alleles. • Alleles for different genes assort independently during meiosis. • The alleles an individual inherits make up the individual’s genotype. The individual may be homozygous (two of the same alleles) or heterozygous (two different alleles). • The expression of an organism’s genotype produces its phenotype. • When only one of two alleles is expressed, the expressed allele is the dominant allele, and the allele that isn’t expressed is the recessive allele. • Mendel used the percentage of phenotypes in offspring to understand how characteristics are inherited.

What are the odds of landing on 25 again? Not as high as inheriting an allele from a parent. Probability plays a big role in determining the chance of inheriting an allele from a parent. It is similar to tossing a coin. What’s the chance of the coin landing on heads? 
Probability 	  Assume you are a plant breeder trying to develop a new variety of plant that is more useful to humans. You plan to cross-pollinate an insect-resistant plant with a plant that grows rapidly. Your goal is to produce a variety of plant that is both insect resistant and fast growing. What percentage of the offspring would you expect to have both characteristics? Mendel’s laws can be used to find out. However, to understand how Mendel’s laws can be used in this way, you first need to know about probability. Probability is the likelihood, or chance, that a certain event will occur. The easiest way to understand probability is with coin tosses (see Figure 3.7). When you toss a coin, the chance of a head turning up is 50 percent. This is because a coin has only two sides, so there is an equal chance of a head or tail turning up on any given toss. If you toss a coin twice, you might expect to get one head and one tail. But each time you toss the coin, the chance of a head is still 50 percent. Therefore, it’s quite likely that you will get two or even several heads (or tails) in a row. What if you tossed a coin ten times? You would probably get more or less than the expected five heads. For example, you might get seven heads (70 percent) and three tails (30 percent). The more times you toss the coin, however, the closer you will get to 50 percent heads. For example, if you tossed a coin 1000 times, you might get 510 heads and 
Tossing a  Coin.  Competitions often begin 	  with the toss of a coin. Why is this a fair way to decide who goes first? If you choose heads, what is the chance that the toss will go your way? 
Probability and  Inheritance 	  The same rules of probability in coin tossing apply to the main events that determine the genotypes of offspring. These events are the formation of gametes during meiosis and the union of gametes during fertilization. 
Probability and  Gamete  Formation 	  How is gamete formation like tossing a coin? Consider Mendel’s purple-flowered pea plants again. Assume that a plant is heterozygous for the flower-color allele, so it has the genotype Bb (see Figure 3.8). During meiosis, homologous chromosomes, and the alleles they carry, segregate and go to different gametes. Therefore, when the Bb pea plant forms gametes, the B and b alleles segregate and go to different gametes. As a result, half the gametes produced by the Bb parent will have the B allele and half will have the b allele. Based on the rules of probability, any given gamete of this parent has a 50 percent chance of having the B allele and a 50 percent chance of having the b allele. 
Probability and  Fertilization 	  Which of these gametes joins in fertilization with the gamete of another parent plant? This is a matter of chance, like tossing a coin. Thus, we can assume that either type of gamete—one with the B allele or one with the b allele—has an equal chance of uniting with any of the gametes produced by the other parent. Now assume that the other parent is also Bb. If gametes of two Bb parents unite, what is the chance of the offspring having one of each allele like the parents (Bb)? What is the chance of them having a different combination of alleles than the parents (either BB or bb)? To answer these questions, geneticists use a simple tool called a Punnett square, which is the focus of the next concept. 
Summary 	  • Probability is the chance that a certain event will occur. For example, the probability of a head turning up on any given coin toss is 50 percent.

What do you get when you cross an apple and an orange? Though the above fruit may not result, it would be nice to scientifically predict what would result. Predicting the possible genotypes and phenotypes from a genetic cross is often aided by a Punnett square. 
Punnett  Squares 	  A Punnett square is a chart that allows you to easily determine the expected percentage of different genotypes in the offspring of two parents. An example of a Punnett square for pea plants is shown in Figure 3.9. In this example, both parents are heterozygous for flower color (Bb). The gametes produced by the male parent are at the top of the chart, and the gametes produced by the female parent are along the side. The different possible combinations of alleles in their offspring are determined by filling in the cells of the Punnett square with the correct letters (alleles). At the link below, you can watch an animation in which Reginald Punnett, inventor of the Punnett square, explains the purpose of his invention and how to use it. URL An explanation of Punnett squares can be viewed at URL (25:16). Another example of the use of a Punnett square can be viewed at URL wg (5:40). Click image to the left or use the URL below. This Punnett square shows a cross between two heterozygotes, Bb. Do you know where each letter in all four cells comes from? Two pea plants, both heterozygous for flower color, are crossed. The offspring will show the dominant purple coloration in a 3:1 ratio. Or, about 75% of the offspring will be purple. (allele) 
Predicting  Offspring  Genotypes 	  In the cross shown in Figure 3.9, you can see that one out of four offspring (25 percent) has the genotype BB, one out of four (25 percent) has the genotype bb, and two out of four (50 percent) have the genotype Bb. These percentages of genotypes are what you would expect in any cross between two heterozygous parents. Of course, when just four offspring are produced, the actual percentages of genotypes may vary by chance from the expected percentages. However, if you considered hundreds of such crosses and thousands of offspring, you would get very close to the expected results, just like tossing a coin. 
Predicting  Offspring  Phenotypes 	  You can predict the percentages of phenotypes in the offspring of this cross from their genotypes. B is dominant to b, so offspring with either the BB or Bb genotype will have the purple-flower phenotype. Only offspring with the bb genotype will have the white-flower phenotype. Therefore, in this cross, you would expect three out of four (75 percent) of the offspring to have purple flowers and one out of four (25 percent) to have white flowers. These are the same percentages that Mendel got in his first experiment. 
Determining  Missing  Genotypes 	  A Punnett square can also be used to determine a missing genotype based on the other genotypes involved in a cross. Suppose you have a parent plant with purple flowers and a parent plant with white flowers. Because the b allele is recessive, you know that the white-flowered parent must have the genotype bb. The purple-flowered parent, on the other hand, could have either the BB or the Bb genotype. The Punnett square in Figure 3.10 shows this cross. The question marks (?) in the chart could be either B or b alleles. Can you tell what the genotype of the purple-flowered parent is from the information in the Punnett square? No; you also need to know the genotypes of the offspring in row 2. What if you found out that two of the four offspring have white flowers? Now you know that the offspring in the second row must have the bb genotype. One of their Punnett Square: Cross Between White-Flowered and Purple-Flowered Pea Plants. This Punnett square shows a cross between a white-flowered pea plant and a purple-flowered pea plant. Can you fill in the missing alleles? What do you need to know about the offspring to complete their genotypes? b alleles obviously comes from the white-flowered (bb) parent, because that’s the only allele this parent has. The other b allele must come from the purple-flowered parent. Therefore, the parent with purple flowers must have the genotype Bb. 
Punnett  Square for  Two  Characteristics 	  When you consider more than one characteristic at a time, using a Punnett square is more complicated. This is because many more combinations of alleles are possible. For example, with two genes each having two alleles, an individual has four alleles, and these four alleles can occur in 16 different combinations. This is illustrated for pea plants in Figure 3.11. In this cross, known as a dihybrid cross, both parents are heterozygous for pod color (Gg) and pod form (Ff ). 
Summary 	  • A Punnett square is a chart that allows you to determine the expected percentages of different genotypes in the offspring of two parents. • A Punnett square allows the prediction of the percentages of phenotypes in the offspring of a cross from known genotypes. • A Punnett square can be used to determine a missing genotype based on the other genotypes involved in a cross.

Green, blue, brown, black, hazel, violet, or grey. What color are your eyes? Of course human eyes do not come in multi-color, but they do come in many colors. How do eyes come in so many colors? That brings us to complex inheritance patterns, known as non-Mendelian inheritance. Many times inheritance is more complicated than the simple patterns observed by Mendel. 
Non- Mendelian  Inheritance 	  The inheritance of characteristics is not always as simple as it is for the characteristics that Mendel studied in pea plants. Each characteristic Mendel investigated was controlled by one gene that had two possible alleles, one of which was completely dominant to the other. This resulted in just two possible phenotypes for each characteristic. Each characteristic Mendel studied was also controlled by a gene on a different (nonhomologous) chromosome. As a result, each characteristic was inherited independently of the other characteristics. Geneticists now know that inheritance is often more complex than this. A characteristic may be controlled by one gene with two alleles, but the two alleles may have a different relationship than the simple dominant-recessive relationship that you have read about so far. For example, the two alleles may have a codominant or incompletely dominant relationship. The former is illustrated by the flower in Figure 3.12, and the latter in Figure 3.13. 
Codominance 	  Codominance occurs when both alleles are expressed equally in the phenotype of the heterozygote. The red and white flower in the figure has codominant alleles for red petals and white petals. 
Codominance.  The flower has red and 	  white petals because of codominance of red-petal and white-petal alleles. 
Incomplete  Dominance 	  Incomplete dominance occurs when the phenotype of the offspring is somewhere in between the phenotypes of both parents; a completely dominant allele does not occur. For example, when red snapdragons (CRCR) are crossed with white snapdragons (CW CW ), the F1 hybrids are all pink heterozygotes for flower color (CRCW ). The pink color is an intermediate between the two parent colors. When two F1 (CRCW ) hybrids are crossed they will produce red, pink, and white flowers. The genotype of an organism with incomplete dominance can be determined from its phenotype ( Figure 3.13). 
Incomplete  Dominance.  The flower has 	  pink petals because of incomplete dominance of a red-petal allele and a recessive white-petal allele. 
Multiple  Alleles 	  Many genes have multiple (more than two) alleles. An example is ABO blood type in humans. There are three common alleles for the gene that controls this characteristic. The alleles IA and IB are dominant over i. A person who is homozygous recessive ii has type O blood. Homozygous dominant IAIA or heterozygous dominant IAi have type A blood, and homozygous dominant IBIB or heterozygous dominant IBi have type B blood. IAIB people have type AB blood, because the A and B alleles are codominant. Type A and type B parents can have a type AB child. Type A and type B parents can also have a child with Type O blood, if they are both heterozygous (IBi, IAi). • Type A blood: IAIA, IAi • Type B blood: IB IB, IB i • Type AB blood: IAIB • Type O blood: ii 
Polygenic  Characteristics 	  Polygenic characteristics are controlled by more than one gene, and each gene may have two or more alleles. The genes may be on the same chromosome or on nonhomologous chromosomes. • If the genes are located close together on the same chromosome, they are likely to be inherited together. However, it is possible that they will be separated by crossing-over during meiosis, in which case they may be inherited independently of one another. • If the genes are on nonhomologous chromosomes, they may be recombined in various ways because of independent assortment. For these reasons, the inheritance of polygenic characteristics is very complicated. Such characteristics may have many possible phenotypes. Skin color and adult height are examples of polygenic characteristics in humans. Do you have any idea how many phenotypes each characteristic has? 
Human  Adult  Height.  Like many other 	  polygenic traits, adult height has a bellshaped distribution. 
Effects of  Environment on  Phenotype 	  Genes play an important role in determining an organism’s characteristics. However, for many characteristics, the individual’s phenotype is influenced by other factors as well. Environmental factors, such as sunlight and food availability, can affect how genes are expressed in the phenotype of individuals. Here are just two examples: • Genes play an important part in determining our adult height. However, factors such as poor nutrition can prevent us from achieving our full genetic potential. • Genes are a major determinant of human skin color. However, exposure to ultraviolet radiation can increase the amount of pigment in the skin and make it appear darker. 
Summary 	  • Many characteristics have more complex inheritance patterns than those studied by Mendel. They are complicated by factors such as codominance, incomplete dominance, multiple alleles, and environmental influences.

The  Human  Genome 	  What makes each one of us unique? You could argue that the environment plays a role, and it does to some extent. But most would agree that your parents have something to do with your uniqueness. In fact, it is our genes that make each one of us unique –or at least genetically unique. We all have the genes that make us human: the genes for skin and bones, eyes and ears, fingers and toes, and so on. However, we all have different skin colors, different bone sizes, different eye colors and different ear shapes. In fact, even though we have the same genes, the products of these genes work a little differently in most of us. And that is what makes us unique. The human genome is the genome all the DNA of Homo sapiens. Humans have about 3 billion bases of information, divided into roughly 20,000 to 22,000 genes, which are spread among non-coding sequences and distributed among 24 distinct chromosomes (22 autosomes plus the X and Y sex chromosomes) (3.15). The genome is all of the hereditary information encoded in the DNA, including the genes and non-coding sequences. Thanks to the Human Genome Project, scientists now know the DNA sequence of the entire human genome. The Human Genome Project is an international project that includes scientists from around the world. It began in 1990, and by 2003, scientists had sequenced all 3 billion base pairs of human DNA. Now they are trying to identify all the 
Genes.  Each chromosome of the human 	  genome contains many genes as well as noncoding intergenic (between genes) regions. Each pair of chromosomes is shown here in a different color. genes in the sequence. The Human Genome Project has produced a reference sequence of the human genome. The human genome consists of protein-coding exons, associated introns and regulatory sequences, genes that encode other RNA molecules, and other DNA sequences (sometimes referred to as "junk" DNA), which are regions in which no function as yet been identified. You can watch a video about the Human Genome Project and how it cracked the "code of life" at this link: URL ww.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/genome/program.html .

E:  The  Encyclopedia of  A  Elements 	  In September 2012, ENCODE, The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements, was announced. ENCODE was a colossal project, involving over 440 scientists in 32 labs the world-over, whose goal was to understand the human genome. It had been thought that about 80% of the human genome was "junk" DNA. ENCODE has established that this is not true. Now it is thought that about 80% of the genome is active. In fact, much of the human genome is regulatory sequences, on/off switches that tell our genes what to do and when to do it. Dr. Eric Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health which organized this project, states, "It’s this incredible choreography going on, of a modest number of genes and an immense number of ... switches that are choreographing how those genes are used." It is now thought that at least three-quarters of the genome is involved in making RNA, and most of this RNA appears to help regulate gene activity. Scientists have also identified about 4 million sites where proteins bind to DNA and act in a regulatory capacity. These new findings demonstrate that the human genome has remarkable and precise, and complex, controls over the expression of genetic information within a cell. See ENCODE data describes function of human genome at URL for additional information.

Coiled bundles of DNA and proteins, containing hundreds or thousands of genes. What are these things? Chromosomes. These ensure that each cell receives the proper amount of DNA during cell division. And usually people have 46 of them, 23 from each parent. 
Chromosomes and  Genes 	  Each species has a characteristic number of chromosomes. Chromosomes are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins called histones ( Figure 3.16). Chromosomes are the form of the genetic material of a cell during cell division. See the "Chromosomes" section for additional information. The human species is characterized by 23 pairs of chromosomes, as shown in Figure 3.17. You can watch a short animation about human chromosomes at this link: URL omosomes-including-sex-chromosomes-3D-animation.html . 
Autosomes 	  Of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, 22 pairs are autosomes (numbers 1–22 in Figure 3.17). Autosomes are chromosomes that contain genes for characteristics that are unrelated to sex. These chromosomes are the same in males and females. The great majority of human genes are located on autosomes. At the link below, you can click on any human chromosome to see which traits its genes control. URL me/posters/chromosome/chooser.shtml The human genome has 23 pairs of chromosomes located in the nucleus of somatic cells. Each chromosome is composed of genes and other DNA wound around histones (proteins) into a tightly coiled molecule. 
Sex  Chromosomes 	  The remaining pair of human chromosomes consists of the sex chromosomes, X and Y. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y chromosome. 
In females, one of the  X chromosomes in each 	  cell is inactivated and known as a Barr body. This ensures that females, like males, have only one functioning copy of the X chromosome in each cell. As you can see from Figure 3.16 and Figure 3.17, the X chromosome is much larger than the Y chromosome. The X chromosome has about 2,000 genes, whereas the Y chromosome has fewer than 100, none of which are essential to survival. (For comparison, the smallest autosome, chromosome 22, has over 500 genes.) Virtually all of the X chromosome genes are unrelated to sex. Only the Y chromosome contains genes that determine sex. A single Y chromosome gene, called SRY (which stands for sex-determining region Y gene), triggers an embryo to develop into a male. Without a Y chromosome, an individual develops into a female, so you can think of female as the default sex of the human species. Can you think of a reason why the Y chromosome is so much smaller than the X chromosome? At the link that follows, you can watch an animation that explains why: URL nteractive/gender/Y_evolution.html . 
Human  Genes 	  Humans have an estimated 20,000 to 22,000 genes. This may sound like a lot, but it really isn’t. Far simpler species have almost as many genes as humans. However, human cells use splicing and other processes to make multiple proteins from the instructions encoded in a single gene. Of the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome, only about 
Human  Chromosomes.  Humans have 23 	  pairs of chromosomes. Pairs 1-22 are autosomes. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have an X and a Y chromosome. unclear. To learn more about the coding and noncoding sequences of human DNA, watch the animation at this link: URL . The majority of human genes have two or more possible alleles, which are alternative forms of a gene. Differences in alleles account for the considerable genetic variation among people. In fact, most human genetic variation is the result of differences in individual DNA bases within alleles. 
Summary 	  • Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Of these, 22 pairs are autosomes. • The X and Y chromosomes are the sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes, and males have one X and one Y. • Human chromosomes contain a total of 20,000 to 22,000 genes, the majority of which have two or more alleles.

What does it mean to be linked? For a pair of hands, the above image may suggest a certain type of linkage. For genes, it might suggest that they are very hard to separate. 
Linkage 	  Genes that are located on the same chromosome are called linked genes. Alleles for these genes tend to segregate together during meiosis, unless they are separated by crossing-over. Crossing-over occurs when two homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material during meiosis I. The closer together two genes are on a chromosome, the less likely their alleles will be separated by crossing-over. At the following link, you can watch an animation showing how genes on the same chromosome may be separated by crossing-over: URL Linkage explains why certain characteristics are frequently inherited together. For example, genes for hair color and eye color are linked, so certain hair and eye colors tend to be inherited together, such as blonde hair with blue eyes and brown hair with brown eyes. What other human traits seem to occur together? Do you think they might be controlled by linked genes? 
Sex- Linked  Genes 	  Genes located on the sex chromosomes are called sex-linked genes. Most sex-linked genes are on the X chromosome, because the Y chromosome has relatively few genes. Strictly speaking, genes on the X chromosome are X-linked genes, but the term sex-linked is often used to refer to them. Sex-linked traits are discussed at URL (14:19). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Mapping  Linkage 	  Linkage can be assessed by determining how often crossing-over occurs between two genes on the same chromosome. Genes on different (nonhomologous) chromosomes are not linked. They assort independently during meiosis, so they have a 50 percent chance of ending up in different gametes. If genes show up in different gametes less than chromosome. They may be separated by crossing-over, but this is likely to occur less than 50 percent of the time. The lower the frequency of crossing-over, the closer together on the same chromosome the genes are presumed to be. Frequencies of crossing-over can be used to construct a linkage map like the one in Figure 3.18. A linkage map shows the locations of genes on a chromosome. Linkage Map for the Human X Chromosome. This linkage map shows the locations of several genes on the X chromosome. Some of the genes code for normal proteins. Others code for abnormal proteins that lead to genetic disorders. Which pair of genes would you expect to have a lower frequency of crossing-over: the genes that code for hemophilia A and G6PD deficiency, or the genes that code for protan and Xm? 
Summary 	  • Linked genes are located on the same chromosome. • Sex-linked genes are located on a sex chromosome, and X-linked genes are located on the X chromosome. • The frequency of crossing-over between genes is used to construct linkage maps that show the locations of genes on chromosomes.

What number can you see? Red-green colorblindness is a common inherited trait in humans. About 1 in 10 men have some form of color blindness, however, very few women are color blind. Why? 
Mendelian  Inheritance in  Humans 	  Characteristics that are encoded in DNA are called genetic traits. Different types of human traits are inherited in different ways. Some human traits have simple inheritance patterns like the traits that Gregor Mendel studied in pea plants. Other human traits have more complex inheritance patterns. Mendelian inheritance refers to the inheritance of traits controlled by a single gene with two alleles, one of which may be dominant to the other. Not many human traits are controlled by a single gene with two alleles, but they are a good starting point for understanding human heredity. How Mendelian traits are inherited depends on whether the traits are controlled by genes on autosomes or the X chromosome. 
Autosomal  Traits 	  Autosomal traits are controlled by genes on one of the 22 human autosomes. Consider earlobe attachment. A single autosomal gene with two alleles determines whether you have attached earlobes or free-hanging earlobes. The allele for free-hanging earlobes (F) is dominant to the allele for attached earlobes (f ). Other single-gene autosomal traits include widow’s peak and hitchhiker’s thumb. The dominant and recessive forms of these traits are shown in Figure The chart in Figure 3.19 is called a pedigree. It shows how the earlobe trait was passed from generation to generation within a family. Pedigrees are useful tools for studying inheritance patterns. You can watch a video explaining how pedigrees are used and what they reveal at this link: URL om/watch?v=HbIHjsn5cHo . Having free-hanging earlobes is an autosomal dominant trait. This figure shows the trait and how it was inherited in a family over three generations. Shading indicates people who have the recessive form of the trait. Look at (or feel) your own earlobes. Which form of the trait do you have? Can you tell which genotype you have? Other single-gene autosomal traits include widow’s peak and hitchhiker’s thumb. The dominant and recessive forms of these traits are shown in Figure 3.20. Which form of these traits do you have? What are your possible genotypes for the traits? 
Sex- Linked  Traits 	  Traits controlled by genes on the sex chromosomes are called sex-linked traits, or X-linked traits in the case of the X chromosome. Single-gene X-linked traits have a different pattern of inheritance than single-gene autosomal traits. Do you know why? It’s because males have just one X chromosome. In addition, they always inherit their X chromosome from their mother, and they pass it on to all their daughters but none of their sons. This is illustrated in Because males have just one X chromosome, they have only one allele for any X-linked trait. Therefore, a recessive X-linked allele is always expressed in males. Because females have two X chromosomes, they have two alleles for any X-linked trait. Therefore, they must inherit two copies of the recessive allele to express the recessive trait. This explains why X-linked recessive traits are less common in females than males. An example of a recessive X-linked trait is red-green color blindness. People with this trait cannot distinguish between the colors red and green. More than one recessive gene on the X chromosome codes for this trait, which is fairly common in males but relatively rare in females ( Figure 3.22). At the following link, you can watch an animation about another X-linked recessive trait called hemophilia A: URL s-.html . Widow’s peak and hitchhiker’s thumb are dominant traits controlled by a single autosomal gene.

Genetic  Disorders 	  Many genetic disorders are caused by mutations in one or a few genes. Other genetic disorders are caused by abnormal numbers of chromosomes. 
Genetic  Disorders  Caused by  Mutations 	  The Table 3.2 lists several genetic disorders caused by mutations in just one gene. Some of the disorders are caused by mutations in autosomal genes, others by mutations in X-linked genes. Which disorder would you expect to be more common in males than females?

Mode of  Inheritance 	  autosomal dominant autosomal recessive 
X-linked recessive 	  Few genetic disorders are controlled by dominant alleles. A mutant dominant allele is expressed in every individual who inherits even one copy of it. If it causes a serious disorder, affected people may die young and fail to reproduce. Therefore, the mutant dominant allele is likely to die out of the population. A mutant recessive allele, such as the allele that causes sickle cell anemia (see Figure 3.23 and the link that follows), is not expressed in people who inherit just one copy of it. These people are called carriers. They do not have the disorder themselves, but they carry the mutant allele and can pass it to their offspring. Thus, the allele is likely to pass on to the next generation rather than die out. URL Cystic Fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease are two additional severe genetic disorders.

The mutation that 	  causes the disorder affects just one amino acid in a single protein, but it has serious consequences for the affected person. This photo shows the sickle shape of red blood cells in people with sickle cell anemia. 
Chromosomal  Disorders 	  Mistakes may occur during meiosis that result in nondisjunction. This is the failure of replicated chromosomes to separate during meiosis (the animation at the link below shows how this happens). Some of the resulting gametes will be missing a chromosome, while others will have an extra copy of the chromosome. If such gametes are fertilized and form zygotes, they usually do not survive. If they do survive, the individuals are likely to have serious genetic disorders. Table 3.3 lists several genetic disorders that are caused by abnormal numbers of chromosomes. Most chromosomal disorders involve the X chromosome. Look back at the X and Y chromosomes and you will see why. The X and Y chromosomes are very different in size, so nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes occurs relatively often. URL

Treating  Genetic  Disorders 	  The symptoms of genetic disorders can sometimes be treated, but cures for genetic disorders are still in the early stages of development. One potential cure that has already been used with some success is gene therapy. This involves inserting normal genes into cells with mutant genes.

Generally, the purpose of biotechnology is to create organisms that are useful to humans or to cure genetic disorders. For example, biotechnology may be used to create crops that resist insect pests or yield more food, or to create new treatments for human diseases. Biotechnology: The Invisible Revolution can be seen at URL . What does biotechnology have to do with me? Is discussed in the following video: URL ?v=rrT5BT_7HdI (10:01). Biotechnology uses a variety of techniques to achieve its aims. Two commonly used techniques are gene cloning and the polymerase chain reaction. 
Gene  Cloning 	  Gene cloning is the process of isolating and making copies of a gene. This is useful for many purposes. For example, gene cloning might be used to isolate and make copies of a normal gene for gene therapy. Gene cloning involves four steps: isolation, ligation, transformation, and selection.

The DNA that results is called recombinant DNA. organism in this way is also called genetic engineering. necessary step because transformation is not always successful. Only bacteria that contain the recombinant DNA are selected for further use. Ligation. DNA ligase joins together an isolated gene and plasmid DNA. This produces recombinant DNA.

Polymerase  Chain  Reaction 	  The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) makes many copies of a gene or other DNA segment. This might be done in order to make large quantities of a gene for genetic testing. PCR involves three steps: denaturing, annealing, and extension. The three steps are illustrated in Figure 3.26. They are repeated many times in a cycle to make large quantities of the gene. You can watch animations of PCR at these links: • URL • URL • URL .

Applications of  Biotechnology 	  Methods of biotechnology can be used for many practical purposes. They are used widely in both medicine and agriculture. To see how biotechnology can be used to solve crimes, watch the video "Justice DNA—Freeing the Innocent" at the following link: URL . 
Applications in  Medicine 	  In addition to gene therapy for genetic disorders, biotechnology can be used to transform bacteria so they are able to make human proteins. Figure 3.27 shows how this is done to produce a cytokine, which is a small protein that Genetically Engineering Bacteria to Produce a Human Protein. Bacteria can be genetically engineered to produce a human protein, such as a cytokine. A cytokine is a small protein that helps fight infections. helps fight infections. Proteins made by the bacteria are injected into people who cannot produce them because of mutations. Insulin was the first human protein to be produced in this way. Insulin helps cells take up glucose from the blood. People with type 1 diabetes have a mutation in the gene that normally codes for insulin. Without insulin, their blood glucose rises to harmfully high levels. At present, the only treatment for type 1 diabetes is the injection of insulin from outside sources. Until recently, there was no known way to make insulin outside the human body. The problem was solved by gene cloning. The human insulin gene was cloned and used to transform bacterial cells, which could then produce large quantities of human insulin. 
Pharmacogenomics 	  We know that, thanks to our DNA, each of us is a little bit different. Some of those differences are obvious, like eye and hair color. Others are not so obvious, like how our bodies react to medication. Researchers are beginning to look at how to tailor medical treatments to our genetic profiles, in a relatively new field called pharmacogenomics. Some of the biggest breakthroughs have been in cancer treatment.

Applications in  Agriculture 	  Biotechnology has been used to create transgenic crops. Transgenic crops are genetically modified with new genes that code for traits useful to humans. The diagram in Figure 3.28 shows how a transgenic crop is created. You can learn more about how scientists create transgenic crops with the interactive animation "Engineer a Crop: Transgenic Manipulation" at this link: URL . Transgenic crops have been created with a variety of different traits, such as yielding more food, tasting better, surviving drought, and resisting insect pests. Scientists have even created a transgenic purple tomato that contains a cancer-fighting compound and others that have high levels of antioxidants (see Figure 3.29).

Biotechnology 	  • Identify ethical, legal, and social issues raised by biotechnology. Right or wrong? Good or bad? Legal or illegal? The completion of The Human Genome Project is one of the most important scientific events of the past 50 years. However, is knowing all of our DNA a good thing? The advancement of biotechnology has raised many interesting ethical, legal and social questions. 
Ethical,  Legal, and  Social  Issues 	  Imagine someone analyzes part of your DNA. Who controls that information? What if your health insurance company found out you were predisposed to develop a devastating genetic disease. Might they decide to cancel your insurance? Privacy issues concerning genetic information is an important issue in this day and age. ELSI stands for Ethical, Legal and Social Issues. It’s a term associated with the Human Genome project. This project didn’t only have the goal to identify all the genes in the human genome, but also to address the ELSI that might arise from the project. Rapid advances in DNA-based research, human genetics, and their applications have resulted in new and complex ethical and legal issues for society. 
Concerns from  Biotechnology 	  The use of biotechnology has raised a number of ethical, legal, and social issues. Here are just a few: • Who owns genetically modified organisms such as bacteria? Can such organisms be patented like inventions? • Are genetically modified foods safe to eat? Might they have unknown harmful effects on the people who consume them? • Are genetically engineered crops safe for the environment? Might they harm other organisms or even entire ecosystems? • Who controls a person’s genetic information? What safeguards ensure that the information is kept private? • How far should we go to ensure that children are free of mutations? Should a pregnancy be ended if the fetus has a mutation for a serious genetic disorder? Addressing such issues is beyond the scope of this concept. The following example shows how complex the issues may be: A strain of corn has been created with a gene that encodes a natural pesticide. On the positive side, the transgenic corn is not eaten by insects, so there is more corn for people to eat. The corn also doesn’t need to be sprayed with chemical pesticides, which can harm people and other living things. On the negative side, the transgenic corn has been shown to cross-pollinate nearby milkweed plants. Offspring of the cross-pollinated milkweed plants are now known to be toxic to monarch butterfly caterpillars that depend on them for food. Scientists are concerned that this may threaten the monarch species as well as other species that normally eat monarchs. As this example shows, the pros of biotechnology may be obvious, but the cons may not be known until it is too late. Unforeseen harm may be done to people, other species, and entire ecosystems. No doubt the ethical, legal, and social issues raised by biotechnology will be debated for decades to come. For a recent debate about the ethics of applying biotechnology to humans, watch the video at the link below. In the video, a Harvard University professor of government and a Princeton University professor of bioethics debate the science of “perfecting humans.” URL ww.youtube.com/watch?v=-BPna-fSNOE

Introduction 	  What molecule determines many of your traits? Biology of the Molecule. The Molecular Biology chapter focuses on DNA and proteins, and specifically how the "instructions" in DNA are used to make proteins. This model depicts a protein binding to DNA. Notice the "spiral staircase" shape of the DNA molecule, with the globular wrapped protein around it. • State and explain the central dogma of molecular biology. Is it always DNA to RNA to proteins? The central dogma of molecular biology. Coined by Francis Crick. And in his own words, "I called this idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect. I had already used the obvious word hypothesis in the sequence hypothesis, and in addition I wanted to suggest that this new assumption was more central and more powerful." 
Central  Dogma of  Molecular  Biology 	  Your DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, contains the genes that determine who you are. How can this organic molecule control your characteristics? DNA contains instructions for all the proteins your body makes. Proteins, in turn, determine the structure and function of all your cells. What determines a protein’s structure? It begins with the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein. Instructions for making proteins with the correct sequence of amino acids are encoded in DNA. DNA is found in chromosomes. In eukaryotic cells, chromosomes always remain in the nucleus, but proteins are made at ribosomes in the cytoplasm. How do the instructions in DNA get to the site of protein synthesis outside the nucleus? Another type of nucleic acid is responsible. This nucleic acid is RNA, or ribonucleic acid. RNA is a small molecule that can squeeze through pores in the nuclear membrane. It carries the information from DNA in the nucleus to a ribosome in the cytoplasm and then helps assemble the protein. In short: 
A →  A →  Protein 	  Discovering this sequence of events was a major milestone in molecular biology. It is called the central dogma of molecular biology. You can watch a video about the central dogma and other concepts in this lesson at this link: URL (8:07). The vocabulary of DNA, including the two processes involved in the central dogma, transcription and translation, is discussed at URL (18:23). Click image to the left or use the URL below. An overview of protein synthesis can be viewed at URL (10:46). 
Summary 	  • The central dogma of molecular biology states that DNA contains instructions for making a protein, which are copied by RNA. • RNA then uses the instructions to make a protein. • In short: DNA → RNA → Protein, or DNA to RNA to Protein.

The spiral structure in the picture is a large organic molecule. What type of organic molecule is it? Here’s a hint: molecules like this one determine who you are. They contain genetic information that controls your characteristics. They determine your eye color, facial features, and other physical attributes. What molecule is it? You probably answered "DNA." Today, it is commonly known that DNA is the genetic material. For a long time, scientists knew such molecules existed. They were aware that genetic information was contained within organic molecules. However, they didn’t know which type of molecules play this role. In fact, for many decades, scientists thought that proteins were the molecules that carry genetic information. In this section, you will learn how scientists discovered that DNA carries the code of life. 
A, the  Genetic  Material 	  DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is the genetic material in your cells. It was passed on to you from your parents and determines your characteristics. The discovery that DNA is the genetic material was another important milestone in molecular biology. 
Griffith  Searches for the  Genetic  Material 	  Many scientists contributed to the identification of DNA as the genetic material. In the 1920s, Frederick Griffith made an important discovery. He was studying two different strains of a bacterium, called R (rough) strain and S (smooth) strain. He injected the two strains into mice. The S strain killed (virulent) the mice, but the R strain did not (non-virulent) (see Figure 4.1). Griffith also injected mice with S-strain bacteria that had been killed by heat. As expected, the killed bacteria did not harm the mice. However, when the dead S-strain bacteria were mixed with live R-strain bacteria and injected, the mice died. 
Griffith’s  Experimental  Results.  Griffith 	  showed that a substance could be transferred to harmless bacteria and make them deadly. Based on his observations, Griffith deduced that something in the killed S strain was transferred to the previously harmless R strain, making the R strain deadly. He called this process transformation, as something was "transforming" the bacteria from one strain into another strain. What was that something? What type of substance could change the characteristics of the organism that received it? 
Avery’s  Team  Makes a  Major  Contribution 	  In the early 1940s, a team of scientists led by Oswald Avery tried to answer the question raised by Griffith’s results. They inactivated various substances in the S-strain bacteria. They then killed the S-strain bacteria and mixed the remains with live R-strain bacteria. (Keep in mind, the R-strain bacteria usually did not harm the mice.) When they inactivated proteins, the R-strain was deadly to the injected mice. This ruled out proteins as the genetic material. Why? Even without the S-strain proteins, the R strain was changed, or transformed, into the deadly strain. However, when the researchers inactivated DNA in the S strain, the R strain remained harmless. This led to the conclusion that DNA is the substance that controls the characteristics of organisms. In other words, DNA is the genetic material. You can watch an animation about the research of both Griffith and Avery at this link: URL 
Hershey and  Chase  Seal the  Deal 	  The conclusion that DNA is the genetic material was not widely accepted at first. It had to be confirmed by other research. In the 1950s, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase did experiments with viruses and bacteria. Viruses are not made of cells. They are basically DNA inside a protein coat. To reproduce, a virus must insert its own genetic material into a cell (such as a bacterium). Then it uses the cell’s machinery to make more viruses. The researchers used different radioactive elements to label the DNA and proteins in viruses. This allowed them to identify which molecule the viruses inserted into bacteria. DNA was the molecule they identified. This confirmed that DNA is the genetic material.

How do these four structures form DNA? In an extremely elegant model, that’s how. As you will soon see, the model predicts how the DNA sequence can code for proteins, and how the molecule can be replicated. 
Chargaff’s  Rules 	  Other important discoveries about DNA were made in the mid-1900s by Erwin Chargaff. He studied DNA from many different species. He was especially interested in the four different nitrogen bases of DNA: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) (see Figure 4.2). Chargaff found that concentrations of the four bases differed from one species to another. However, within each species, the concentration of adenine was always about the same as the concentration of thymine. The same was true of the concentrations of guanine and cytosine. These observations came to be known as Chargaff’s rules. The significance of the rules would not be revealed until the structure of DNA was discovered. 
The  Double  Helix 	  After DNA was found to be the genetic material, scientists wanted to learn more about it. James Watson and Francis Crick are usually given credit for discovering that DNA has a double helix shape, like a spiral staircase (see Figure Nitrogen Bases in DNA. The DNA of all species has the same four nitrogen bases. learn more about DNA’s structure. Franklin and these other scientists have not always been given credit for their contributions. You can learn more about Franklin’s work by watching the video at this link: URL om/watch?v=s3whouvZYG8 (7:47). The double helix shape of DNA, together with Chargaff’s rules, led to a better understanding of DNA. DNA, as a nucleic acid, is made from nucleotide monomers, and the DNA double helix consists of two polynucleotide chains. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogen-containing base (A, C, G, or T). Scientists concluded that bonds (hydrogen bonds) between complementary bases hold together the two polynucleotide chains of DNA. Adenine always bonds with its complementary base, thymine. Cytosine always bonds with its complementary base, guanine. If you look at the nitrogen bases in Figure 4.2, you will see why. Adenine and guanine have a two-ring structure. Cytosine and thymine have just one ring. If adenine were to bind with guanine and cytosine with thymine, the distance between the two DNA chains would be variable. However, when a one-ring molecule binds with a two-ring molecule, the distance between the two chains is kept constant. This maintains the uniform shape of the DNA double helix. These base pairs (A-T or G-C) stick into the middle of the double helix, forming, in essence, the steps of the spiral staircase. 
A  Replication 	  Knowledge of DNA’s structure helped scientists understand how DNA replicates. DNA replication is the process in which DNA is copied. It occurs during the synthesis (S) phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle. DNA replication begins when an enzyme, DNA helicase, breaks the bonds between complementary bases in DNA (see Figure 4.4). This

Which parts of the DNA molecule are like the steps of the spiral staircase? exposes the bases inside the molecule so they can be “read” by another enzyme, DNA polymerase, and used to build two new DNA strands with complementary bases, also by DNA polymerase. The two daughter molecules that result each contain one strand from the parent molecule and one new strand that is complementary to it. As a result, the two daughter molecules are both identical to the parent molecule. DNA replication is a semi-conservative process because half of the parent DNA molecule is conserved in each of the two daughter DNA molecules. The process of DNA replication is actually much more complex than this simple summary. You can see a detailed animation of the process at this link: URL (2:05). 
Summary 	  • Chargaff’s rules state that the amount of A is similar to the amount of T, and the amount of G is similar to the amount of C. • Watson and Crick discovered that DNA has a double helix shape, consisting of two polynucleotide chains held together by bonds between complementary bases. • DNA replication is semi-conservative: half of the parent DNA molecule is conserved in each of the two daughter DNA molecules.

Summary 	  • RNA differs from DNA in several ways. • There are three main types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA). • Each type plays a different in role in making proteins.

How does a cell use the information in its DNA? To transcribe means ”to paraphrase or summarize in writing”. The information in DNA is transcribed or summarized into a smaller version RNA that can be used by the cell. This process is called transcription. 
Transcription 	  The process in which cells make proteins is called protein synthesis. It actually consists of two processes: transcription and translation. Transcription takes place in the nucleus. 
It uses  A as a template to make an 	  RNA molecule. RNA then leaves the nucleus and goes to a ribosome in the cytoplasm, where translation occurs. Translation reads the genetic code in mRNA and makes a protein. Transcription is the first part of the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA → RNA. It is the transfer of genetic instructions in DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA). During transcription, a strand of mRNA is made that is complementary to a strand of DNA. Figure 4.6 shows how this occurs. You can watch an animation of the process at this link: URL . • A detailed video about transcription is available at this link: URL ovie-flash.htm . 
Overview of  Transcription.  Transcription 	  uses the sequence of bases in a strand of DNA to make a complementary strand of mRNA. Triplets are groups of three successive nucleotide bases in DNA. Codons are complementary groups of bases in mRNA. 
Steps of  Transcription 	  Transcription takes place in three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. The steps are illustrated in Figure a gene called the promoter. This signals the DNA to unwind so the enzyme can ”read” the bases in one of the DNA strands. The enzyme is now ready to make a strand of mRNA with a complementary sequence of bases. strand and builds the mRNA molecule, using complementary base pairs. There is a brief time during this process when the newly formed RNA is bound to the unwound DNA. During this process, an adenine (A) in the DNA binds to an uracil (U) in the RNA. sequence in the gene. The mRNA strand is complete, and it detaches from DNA. 
Processing m 	  In eukaryotes, the new mRNA is not yet ready for translation. It must go through additional processing before it leaves the nucleus. This may include splicing, editing, and polyadenylation. These processes modify the mRNA in various ways. Such modifications allow a single gene to be used to make more than one protein. Steps of Transcription. Transcription occurs in the three steps initiation, elongation, and termination shown here. • Splicing removes introns from mRNA (see Figure 4.8). Introns are regions that do not code for proteins. The remaining mRNA consists only of regions that do code for proteins, which are called exons. You can watch a video showing splicing in more detail at this link: URL vie-flash.htm . Ribonucleoproteins are nucleoproteins that contains RNA. Small nuclear ribonuclearproteins are involved in pre-mRNA splicing. • Editing changes some of the nucleotides in mRNA. For example, the human protein called APOB, which helps transport lipids in the blood, has two different forms because of editing. One form is smaller than the other because editing adds a premature stop signal in the mRNA. • Polyadenylation adds a “tail” to the mRNA. The tail consists of a string of As (adenine bases). It signals the end of mRNA. It is also involved in exporting mRNA from the nucleus. In addition, the tail protects mRNA from enzymes that might break it down. 
Summary 	  • Transcription is the DNA → RNA part of the central dogma of molecular biology. • Transcription occurs in the nucleus. • During transcription, a copy of mRNA is made that is complementary to a strand of DNA. In eukaryotes, mRNA may be modified before it leaves the nucleus.

How do you go from four letters to 20 amino acids? You need a code. And the code that changes the information embedded in DNA and RNA into ordered amino acids and proteins is the genetic code. And every living organism uses the same genetic code. 
The  Genetic  Code 	  How is the information in a gene encoded? The answer is the genetic code. The genetic code consists of the sequence of nitrogen bases—A, C, G, U—in an mRNA chain. The four bases make up the “letters” of the genetic code. The letters are combined in groups of three to form code “words,” called codons. Each codon stands for (encodes) one amino acid, unless it codes for a start or stop signal. There are 20 common amino acids in proteins. There are 64 possible codons, more than enough to code for the 20 amino acids. The genetic code is shown in Figure 4.9. To see how scientists cracked the genetic code, go to this link: URL . 
Reading the  Genetic  Code 	  As shown in Figure 4.9, the codon AUG codes for the amino acid methionine. This codon is also the start codon that begins translation. The start codon establishes the reading frame of mRNA. The reading frame is the way the letters are divided into codons. After the AUG start codon, the next three letters are read as the second codon. The 
The  Genetic  Code.  To find the amino acid 	  for a particular codon, find the cell in the table for the first and second bases of the codon. Then, within that cell, find the codon with the correct third base. For example CUG codes for leucine, AAG codes for lysine, and GGG codes for glycine. next three letters after that are read as the third codon, and so on. This is illustrated in Figure 4.10. The mRNA molecule is read, codon by codon, until a stop codon is reached. UAG, UGA, and UAA are all stop codons. They do not code for any amino acids. Stop codons are also known as termination codons. Reading the Genetic Code. The genetic code is read three bases at a time. 
Codons are the code words of the genetic 	  code. Which amino acid does codon 2 in the drawing stand for? 
Characteristics of the  Genetic  Code 	  The genetic code has a number of important characteristics. • The genetic code is universal. All known living organisms use the same genetic code. This shows that all organisms share a common evolutionary history. • The genetic code is unambiguous. Each codon codes for just one amino acid (or start or stop). What might happen if codons encoded more than one amino acid? • The genetic code is redundant. Most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. In Figure 4.9, how many codons code for the amino acid threonine? What might be an advantage of having more than one codon for the same amino acid? 
Summary 	  • The genetic code consists of the sequence of bases in DNA or RNA. • Groups of three bases form codons, and each codon stands for one amino acid (or start or stop). • The codons are read in sequence following the start codon until a stop codon is reached. • The genetic code is universal, unambiguous, and redundant.

To go from one language to another. Spanish to English, French to German, or nucleotides to amino acids. Which type is the translation of molecular biology? Obviously, the type of translating discussed here translates from the language of nucleotides to the language of amino acids. 
Translation 	  Translation is the second part of the central dogma of molecular biology: RNA → Protein. It is the process in which the genetic code in mRNA is read, one codon at a time, to make a protein. Figure 4.11 shows how this happens. After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it moves to a ribosome, which consists of rRNA and proteins. The ribosome reads the sequence of codons in mRNA. Molecules of tRNA bring amino acids to the ribosome in the correct sequence. To understand the role of tRNA, you need to know more about its structure. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon for the amino acid it carries. An anticodon is a sequence of 3 bases, and is complementary to the codon for an amino acid. For example, the amino acid lysine has the codon AAG, so the anticodon is UUC. Therefore, lysine would be carried by a tRNA molecule with the anticodon UUC. Wherever the codon AAG appears in mRNA, a UUC anticodon on a tRNA temporarily binds to the codon. While bound to the mRNA, the tRNA gives up its amino acid. Bonds form between adjacent amino acids as they are brought one by one to the ribosome, forming a polypeptide Translation of the codons in mRNA to a chain of amino acids occurs at a ribosome.

The chain of amino acids keeps growing until a stop codon is reached. To see how this happens, go the link below. URL (1:29) After a polypeptide chain is synthesized, it may undergo additional processes. For example, it may assume a folded shape due to interactions among its amino acids. It may also bind with other polypeptides or with different types of molecules, such as lipids or carbohydrates. Many proteins travel to the Golgi apparatus to be modified for the specific job they will do. You can see how this occurs by watching the animation at this link: URL u/animations/proteinmodification/movie-flash.htm . 
Summary 	  • Translation is the RNA → Protein part of the central dogma. • Translation occurs at a ribosome. • During translation, a protein is synthesized using the codons in mRNA as a guide. • All three types of RNA play a role in translation.

What causes albinism? This rare albino alligator must have the specific "instructions," or DNA, to have this quality. The cause of albinism is a mutation in a gene for melanin, a protein found in skin and eyes. Such a mutation may result in no melanin production at all or a significant decline in the amount of melanin. 
Mutations 	  A change in the sequence of bases in DNA or RNA is called a mutation. Does the word mutation make you think of science fiction and bug-eyed monsters? Think again. Everyone has mutations. In fact, most people have dozens or even hundreds of mutations in their DNA. Mutations are essential for evolution to occur. They are the ultimate source of all new genetic material new alleles in a species. Although most mutations have no effect on the organisms in which they occur, some mutations are beneficial. Even harmful mutations rarely cause drastic changes in organisms. 
Types of  Mutations 	  There are a variety of types of mutations. Two major categories of mutations are germline mutations and somatic mutations. • Germline mutations occur in gametes. These mutations are especially significant because they can be transmitted to offspring and every cell in the offspring will have the mutation. • Somatic mutations occur in other cells of the body. These mutations may have little effect on the organism because they are confined to just one cell and its daughter cells. Somatic mutations cannot be passed on to offspring. Mutations also differ in the way that the genetic material is changed. Mutations may change the structure of a chromosome or just change a single nucleotide. 
Chromosomal  Alterations 	  Chromosomal alterations are mutations that change chromosome structure. They occur when a section of a chromosome breaks off and rejoins incorrectly or does not rejoin at all. Possible ways these mutations can occur are illustrated in Figure 4.13. Go to this link for a video about chromosomal alterations: URL atch?v=OrXRSqa_3lU (2:18). 
Chromosomal  Alterations.  Chromosomal 	  alterations are major changes in the genetic material. Chromosomal alterations are very serious. They often result in the death of the organism in which they occur. If the organism survives, it may be affected in multiple ways. An example of a human chromosomal alteration is the mutation that causes Down Syndrome. It is a duplication mutation that leads to developmental delays and other abnormalities. 
Point  Mutations 	  A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide in DNA. This type of mutation is usually less serious than a chromosomal alteration. An example of a point mutation is a mutation that changes the codon UUU to the codon UCU. Point mutations can be silent, missense, or nonsense mutations, as shown in Table 4.1. The effects of point mutations depend on how they change the genetic code. You can watch an animation about nonsense mutations at this link: URL .

A (glutamine) →  	  (proline) 
A (glutamine) → 	  UAA (stop) 
Effect 	  none variable usually serious 
Frameshift  Mutations 	  A frameshift mutation is a deletion or insertion of one or more nucleotides that changes the reading frame of the base sequence. Deletions remove nucleotides, and insertions add nucleotides. Consider the following sequence of bases in RNA: 
G- U- G- U = start-asparagine-threonine-alanine 	  Now, assume an insertion occurs in this sequence. Let’s say an A nucleotide is inserted after the start codon AUG: 
G- A- C- C- U = start-lysine-tyrosine-glycine 	  Even though the rest of the sequence is unchanged, this insertion changes the reading frame and thus all of the codons that follow it. As this example shows, a frameshift mutation can dramatically change how the codons in mRNA are read. This can have a drastic effect on the protein product. 
Summary 	  • Germline mutations occur in gametes. Somatic mutations occur in other body cells. • Chromosomal alterations are mutations that change chromosome structure. • Point mutations change a single nucleotide. • Frameshift mutations are additions or deletions of nucleotides that cause a shift in the reading frame.

It mutates DNA. The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on April 26, 1986. It is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history. A Russian publication concludes that 985,000 excess cancers occurred between 1986 and 2004 as a result of radioactive contamination. The 2011 report of the European Committee on Radiation Risk calculates a total of 1.4 million excess cancers occurred as a result of this contamination. 
Causes of  Mutation 	  Mutations have many possible causes. Some mutations seem to happen spontaneously without any outside influence. They can occur when mistakes are made during DNA replication or transcription. Other mutations are caused by environmental factors. Anything in the environment that can cause a mutation is known as a mutagen. Examples of mutagens are pictured in Figure 4.14. For a video about mutagens, go the link below. URL atch?v=0wrNxCGKCws (0:36) 
Spontaneous  Mutations 	  There are five common types of spontaneous mutations. These are described in the Table 4.2. Examples of Mutagens. Types of mutagens include radiation, chemicals, and infectious agents. Do you know of other examples of each type of mutagen shown here?

The  Chernobyl  Disaster:  Follow-up 	  Though the area immediately around the Chernobyl disaster may not be safe for human life for thousands of years, the Exclusion Zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power station has become a haven for wildlife. As humans were evacuated from the area 25 years ago, existing animal populations multiplied and rare species not seen for centuries have returned or have been reintroduced, for example lynx, wild boar, wolf, Eurasian brown bear, European bison, Przewalski’s horse, and eagle owl. The Exclusion Zone is so lush with wildlife and greenery that in 2007 the Ukrainian government designated it a wildlife sanctuary. It is now one of the largest wildlife sanctuaries in Europe. 
Summary 	  • Mutations are caused by environmental factors known as mutagens. • Types of mutagens include radiation, chemicals, and infectious agents. • Mutations may be spontaneous in nature. 
Making  Connections 	  • Describe beneficial mutations. • Give examples of harmful mutations. Is this rat hairless? Yes. Why? The result of a mutation, a change in the DNA sequence. The effects of mutations can vary widely, from being beneficial, to having no effect, to having lethal consequences, and every possibility in between. 
Effects of  Mutations 	  The majority of mutations have neither negative nor positive effects on the organism in which they occur. These mutations are called neutral mutations. Examples include silent point mutations. They are neutral because they do not change the amino acids in the proteins they encode. Many other mutations have no effect on the organism because they are repaired before protein synthesis occurs. Cells have multiple repair mechanisms to fix mutations in DNA. One way DNA can be repaired is illustrated in dividing. 
A  Repair  Pathway.  This flow chart 	  shows one way that damaged DNA is repaired in E. coli bacteria. 
Beneficial  Mutations 	  Some mutations have a positive effect on the organism in which they occur. They are called beneficial mutations. They lead to new versions of proteins that help organisms adapt to changes in their environment. Beneficial mutations are essential for evolution to occur. They increase an organism’s changes of surviving or reproducing, so they are likely to become more common over time. There are several well-known examples of beneficial mutations. Here are just two: to antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. atherosclerosis, which is the dangerous buildup of fatty materials in blood vessels. The individual in which the mutation first appeared has even been identified. 
Harmful  Mutations 	  Imagine making a random change in a complicated machine such as a car engine. The chance that the random change would improve the functioning of the car is very small. The change is far more likely to result in a car that does not run well or perhaps does not run at all. By the same token, any random change in a gene’s DNA is likely to result in a protein that does not function normally or may not function at all. Such mutations are likely to be harmful. Harmful mutations may cause genetic disorders or cancer. • A genetic disorder is a disease caused by a mutation in one or a few genes. A human example is cystic fibrosis. A mutation in a single gene causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and blocks ducts in digestive organs. You can watch a video about cystic fibrosis and other genetic disorders at this link: URL (9:31). • Cancer is a disease in which cells grow out of control and form abnormal masses of cells. It is generally caused by mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide without limits. Cancer genes can be inherited. You can learn more about hereditary cancer by watching the video at the following link: URL (4:29)

Can your expression change at any moment? As you know, a person’s expression can change moment by moment. The expression that is demonstrated is usually appropriate for that moment’s feelings. Gene expression is the use of a gene whose product is necessary for that moment. It may be a moment during development, it may be a moment of increased anxiety, or it may be in response to an environmental change. Whenever a particular protein is needed, gene expression provides it. 
Gene  Expression 	  Each of your cells has at least 20,000 genes. In fact, all of your cells have the same genes. Do all of your cells make the same proteins? Obviously not. If they did, then all your cells would be alike. Instead, you have cells with different structures and functions. This is because different cells make different proteins. They do this by using, or expressing, different genes. Using a gene to make a protein is called gene expression. 
How  Gene  Expression is  Regulated 	  Gene expression is regulated to ensure that the correct proteins are made when and where they are needed. Regulation may occur at any point in the expression of a gene, from the start of transcription to the processing of a protein after translation. Following is a list of stages where gene expression is regulated: • Chemical and structural modification of DNA or chromatin • Transcription • Translation • Post-transcriptional modification • RNA transport • mRNA degradation • Post-translational modifications As shown in Figure 4.16, transcription is controlled by regulatory proteins binding to the DNA. Specifically, gene regulation at the level of transcription controls when transcription occurs as well as how much RNA is created. A regulatory protein, or a transcription factor, is a protein involved in regulating gene expression. It is usually bound to a cis-regulatory element, which is part of the DNA. Regulatory proteins often must be bound to a cis-regulatory element to switch a gene on ( activator), or to turn a gene off ( repressor). Transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase can be regulated by at least five mechanisms: • Specificity factors (proteins) alter the specificity of RNA polymerase for a promoter or set of promoters, making it more or less likely to bind to the promoter and begin transcription. • Activator proteins enhance the interaction between RNA polymerase and a particular promoter. • Repressor proteins bind to non-coding sequences on the DNA that are close to or overlap the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase’s progress along the strand. • Basal factors are transcription factors that help position RNA polymerase at the start of a gene. • Enhancers are sites on the DNA strand that are bound by activators in order to loop the DNA, bringing a specific transcription factor to the initiation complex. An initiation complex is composed of RNA polymerase and transcription factors. As the organism grows more sophisticated, gene regulation becomes more complex, though prokaryotic organisms possess some highly regulated systems. Some human genes are controlled by many activators and repressors working together. Obviously, a mutation in a cis-regulatory region, such as the promoter, can greatly affect the proper expression of a gene. It may keep the gene permanently off, such that no protein can be made, or it can keep the gene permanently on, such that the corresponding protein is constantly made. Both of these can have detremental effects on the cell. 
Summary 	  • Gene transcription is controlled by regulatory proteins that bind to regulatory elements on DNA. • The proteins usually either activate or repress transcription. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • What is Gene Expression? at URL . Regulation of Transcription. Regulatory proteins bind to regulatory elements to control transcription. The regulatory elements are embedded within the DNA. • Define operon. • Describe gene regulation in prokaryotic cells. • Explain the roles of the operator, the promoter, and the repressor. • Summarize regulation of the lac operon. On or off? When it comes to genes, that is an important question. And if you’re a single-celled organism like a bacterium, conserving energy by not producing unnecessary proteins is very important. 
Prokaryotic  Gene  Regulation 	  Transcription is regulated differently in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In general, prokaryotic regulation is simpler than eukaryotic regulation. 
The  Role of  Operons 	  Regulation of transcription in prokaryotes typically involves operons. An operon is a region of DNA that consists of one or more genes that encode the proteins needed for a specific function. The operon also includes a promoter and an operator. The operator is a region of the operon where regulatory proteins bind. It is located near the promoter and helps regulate transcription of the operon genes. 
The  Lac  Operon 	  A well-known example of operon regulation involves the lac operon in E. coli bacteria (see Figure 4.17 and the video at the link below). The lac operon consists of a promoter, an operator, and three genes that encode the enzymes needed to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk. The lac operon is regulated by lactose in the environment. The Lac Operon video at URL explains the operon in further detail. • When lactose is absent, a repressor protein binds to the operator. The operator is located between the promoter and the three lac operon genes. The protein blocks the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter. As a result, the lac genes are not expressed. • When lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to the operator. This allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and begin transcription. As a result, the lac genes are expressed, and lactose is digested. Why might it be beneficial to express genes only when they are needed? (Hint: synthesizing proteins requires energy and materials.) The three genes of the lac operon are lacZ, lacY, and lacA. They encode proteins needed to digest lactose. The genes are expressed only in the presence of lactose. 
Summary 	  • Regulation of transcription in prokaryotes typically involves an operon, such as the lac operon in E. coli. • The lac operon is regulated by proteins that behave differently depending on whether lactose is present or absent. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Genes can be turned on and off at URL . Gene Machine: The Lac Operon at URL .

On or Off? On or Off? On or Off? That is the key question. Gene regulation in eukaryotes is a highly regulated process usually involving many proteins, which either bind to each other or bind to the DNA. 
Eukaryotic  Gene  Regulation 	  In eukaryotic cells, the start of transcription is one of the most complicated parts of gene regulation. There may be many regulatory proteins and regulatory elements involved. Regulation may also involve enhancers. Enhancers are distant regions of DNA that can loop back to interact with a gene’s promoter. 
The  A  Box 	  Different types of cells have unique patterns of regulatory elements that result in only the necessary genes being transcribed. That’s why a skin cell and nerve cell, for example, are so different from each other. However, some patterns of regulatory elements are common to all genes, regardless of the cells in which they occur. An example is the TATA box, so named because it has a core sequence of TATAAA. This is a regulatory element that is part of the promoter of most eukaryotic genes. A number of regulatory proteins bind to the TATA box, forming a multi-protein complex. It is only when all of the appropriate proteins are bound to the TATA box that RNA polymerase recognizes the complex and binds to the promoter. Once RNA polymerase binds, transcription begins. To see a video showing the role of the TATA box in the initiation of transcription, go to this link: URL I-9aQA . 
Regulation  During  Development 	  The regulation of gene expression is extremely important during the development of an organism. Regulatory proteins must turn on certain genes in particular cells at just the right time so the organism develops normal organs and organ systems. Homeobox genes are an example of genes that regulate development. They code for regulatory proteins that switch on whole series of major developmental genes. In insects, homeobox genes called hox genes ensure that body parts such as limbs develop in the correct place. Figure 4.18 shows how a mutation in a hox gene can affect an insect’s development. Other organisms, including humans, also have how genes. You can learn more about homeobox genes at this link: URL . 
Effect of  Hox  Gene  Mutation.  Scientists 	  caused a mutation in a hox gene of this fruit fly. As a result of the mutation, a leg grew out of its head where an antenna should have developed. 
Gene  Expression and  Cancer 	  The mutations that cause cancer generally occur in two types of regulatory genes: tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes (see Figure 4.19). These genes produce regulatory proteins that control the cell cycle. When the genes mutate, cells with mutations divide rapidly and without limits, potentially resulting in a tumor and cancer. 
How  Cancer  Develops.  This flow chart 	  shows how a series of mutations in tumorsuppressor genes and proto-oncogenes leads to cancer. 
Summary 	  • Regulation of transcription in eukaryotes is generally more complex than in prokaryotes. It involves unique regulatory elements in different cells as well as common regulatory elements such as the TATA box. • Regulation is especially important during development. It may involve regulatory genes such as homeobox genes that switch other regulatory genes on or off. • Mutations in regulatory genes that normally control the cell cycle cause cancer.

Summary 	  Molecular Biology focuses on DNA and how proteins are made. DNA contains the information used to make RNA. RNA leaves the nucleus and, together with a ribosome, makes proteins. The genetic code is the universal code that all life uses to turn the language of nucleotides into the language of amino acids. Mistakes in the DNA or RNA sequence can have dangerous consequences for the organism, though these same "mistakes" are the driving force of evolution.

Introduction 	  Do dinosaurs prove evolution? For millions of years dinosaurs roamed and dominated the planet. Then 65 million years ago, they went extinct. In fact, over 90% of species that have lived are now extinct. The change in species over time is evolution, the focus of the lessons in the Evolution chapter. • Define fossil. • Describe the fossil record. • Compare relative dating to absolute dating. • Describe the role of molecular clocks. • Summarize the geologic time scale. How do we learn about the past? We study the remains of things that existed many years ago. The Ruins of Pompeii have given archeologists, historians, and other scholars a tremendous amount of information about life two thousand years ago. This section discusses studying things that are many thousands of years older than these remains. 
Earth in a  Day 	  It’s hard to grasp the vast amounts of time since Earth formed and life first appeared on its surface. It may help to think of Earth’s history as a 24-hour day, as shown in Figure 5.1. Humans would have appeared only during the last minute of that day. If we are such newcomers on planet Earth, how do we know about the vast period of time that went before us? How have we learned about the distant past? 
Learning  About the  Past 	  Much of what we know about the history of life on Earth is based on the fossil record. Detailed knowledge of modern organisms also helps us understand how life evolved. 
In this model 	  History of Earth in a Day. of Earth’s history, the planet formed at midnight. What time was it when the first prokaryotes evolved? 
The  Fossil  Record 	  Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms that lived in the past. The soft parts of organisms almost always decompose quickly after death. On occasion, the hard parts—mainly bones, teeth, or shells—remain long enough to mineralize and form fossils. An example of a complete fossil skeleton is shown in Figure 5.2. The fossil record is the record of life that unfolded over four billion years and pieced back together through the analysis of fossils. To be preserved as fossils, remains must be covered quickly by sediments or preserved in some other way. For example, they may be frozen in glaciers or trapped in tree resin, like the frog in Figure 5.3. Sometimes traces of organisms—such as footprints or burrows—are preserved (see the fossil footprints in Figure 5.3). The conditions required for fossils to form rarely occur. Therefore, the chance of an organism being preserved as a fossil is very low. You can watch a video at the following link to see in more detail how fossils form: URL atch?v=A5i5Qrp6sJU . In order for fossils to “tell” us the story of life, they must be dated. Then they can help scientists reconstruct how life changed over time. Fossils can be dated in two different ways: relative dating and absolute dating. Both are described below. You can also learn more about dating methods in the video at this link: URL atch?v=jM7vZ-9bBc0 . • Relative dating determines which of two fossils is older or younger than the other, but not their age in years. Relative dating is based on the positions of fossils in rock layers. Lower layers were laid down earlier, so they are assumed to contain older fossils. This is illustrated in Figure 5.4. • Absolute dating determines about how long ago a fossil organism lived. This gives the fossil an approximate age in years. Absolute dating is often based on the amount of carbon-14 or other radioactive element that remains in a fossil. You can learn more about carbon-14 dating by watching the animation at this link: http ://URL . Extinct Lion Fossil. This fossilized skeleton represents an extinct lion species. It is rare for fossils to be so complete and well preserved as this one. The photo on the left shows an ancient frog trapped in hardened tree resin, or amber. The photo on the right shows the fossil footprints of a dinosaur. 
Molecular  Clocks 	  Evidence from the fossil record can be combined with data from molecular clocks. A molecular clock uses DNA sequences (or the proteins they encode) to estimate relatedness among species. Molecular clocks estimate the time in geologic history when related species diverged from a common ancestor. Molecular clocks are based on the assumption that mutations accumulate through time at a steady average rate for a given region of DNA. Species that have accumulated greater differences in their DNA sequences are assumed to have diverged from their common ancestor in the more distant past. Molecular clocks based on different regions of DNA may be used together for Relative Dating Using Rock Layers. Relative dating establishes which of two fossils is older than the other. It is based on the rock layers in which the fossils formed. more accuracy. Consider the example in Table 5.1. The table shows how similar the DNA of several animal species is to human DNA. Based on these data, which organism do you think shared the most recent common ancestor with humans? 
E 5.1:  Comparing  A:  Humans and  Other  Animals 	  Similarity with Human DNA (percent) 
Geologic  Time  Scale 	  Another tool for understanding the history of Earth and its life is the geologic time scale, shown in Figure 5.5. The geologic time scale divides Earth’s history into divisions (such as eons, eras, and periods) that are based on major changes in geology, climate, and the evolution of life. It organizes Earth’s history and the evolution of life on the basis of important events instead of time alone. It also allows more focus to be placed on recent events, about which we know the most. 
Geologic  Time  Scale.  The geologic time 	  scale divides Earth’s history into units that reflect major changes in Earth and its life forms. During which eon did Earth form? What is the present era? 
Summary 	  • Much of what we know about the history of life on Earth is based on the fossil record. • Molecular clocks are used to estimate how long it has been since two species diverged from a common ancestor. • The geologic time scale is another important tool for understanding the history of life on Earth.

Species  	  • Summarize the events of 4.5 billion years ago. • Describe how and when planet Earth formed. What alien planet is represented by this picture? Would it surprise you to learn that the picture represents Earth? After Earth first formed about 4.6 billion years ago, it may well have looked like this. Instead of rivers of water, rivers of molten rock flowed over its surface. Life as we know it could not have survived in such a place. How did this fiery hot planet become today’s Earth, covered with water and teeming with life? The long and incredible story of Earth’s history starts with this section. How Earth Formed: We Are Made of Stardust! We’ll start the story of life at the very beginning, when Earth and the rest of the solar system first formed. The solar system began as a rotating cloud of stardust. “Dust, rocks, and gas” may not sound inspiring, but this cloud contained the 92 elements which somehow combine to form every corner –living and nonliving –of Earth. Then the Big Bang (14 billion years ago) produced the atoms of hydrogen and helium. Elements as heavy as lithium followed the Big Bang within minutes. Stars such as red giants fused hydrogen and helium nuclei to form elements from carbon (the foundation of life) to calcium (now our bones and teeth). Supernova explosions formed and ejected heavier elements such as iron (for red blood cells). We are not just “dust.” We and our world are stardust! How did this rotating cloud of stardust become our solar system? About 4.5 billion years ago, a nearby star exploded and sent a shock wave through the dust cloud, increasing its rate of spin. As a result, most of the mass became concentrated in the middle, forming the sun. Smaller concentrations of mass rotating around the center formed the planets, including Earth. You can watch a video showing how Earth formed at this link: URL . At first, Earth was molten and lacked an atmosphere and oceans. Gradually, the planet cooled and formed a solid crust. As the planet continued to cool, volcanoes released gases, which eventually formed an atmosphere. The early atmosphere contained ammonia, methane, water vapor, and carbon dioxide but only a trace of oxygen. As the atmosphere became denser, clouds formed and rain fell. Water from rain, and perhaps from comets and asteroids that struck Earth as well, eventually formed the oceans. The ancient atmosphere and oceans represented by the picture in Figure 5.6 would be toxic to today’s life, but they set the stage for life to begin. 
Ancient  Earth.  This is how ancient  Earth 	  may have looked after its atmosphere and oceans formed.

Over many years and probably trillions and trillions of chemical reactions, more complex molecules, and more stable molecules, formed. 
The  First  Organic  Molecules 	  All living things consist of organic molecules, centered around the element carbon. Therefore, it is likely that organic molecules evolved before cells, perhaps as long as 4 billion years ago. How did these building blocks of life first form? Scientists think that lightning sparked chemical reactions in Earth’s early atmosphere. The early atmosphere contained gases such as ammonia, methane, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. Scientists hypothesize that this created a “soup” of organic molecules from inorganic chemicals. In 1953, scientists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey used their imaginations to test this hypothesis. They created a simulation experiment to see if organic molecules could arise in this way (see Figure below). They used a mixture of gases to represent Earth’s early atmosphere. Then, they passed sparks through the gases to represent lightning. Within a week, several simple organic molecules had formed. You can watch a dramatization of Miller and Urey’s experiment at this link: URL NNijmxsKGbc . Which Organic Molecule Came First? Living things need organic molecules to store genetic information and to carry out the chemical work of cells. Modern organisms use DNA to store genetic information and proteins to catalyze chemical reactions. So, did DNA or proteins evolve first? This is like asking whether the chicken or the egg came first. DNA encodes proteins and proteins are needed to make DNA, so each type of organic molecule needs the other for its own existence. How could either of these two molecules have evolved before the other? Did some other organic molecule evolve first, instead of DNA or proteins? 
A  World  Hypothesis 	  Some scientists speculate that RNA may have been the first organic molecule to evolve. In fact, they think that early life was based solely on RNA and that DNA and proteins evolved later. This is called the RNA world hypothesis. Why RNA? It can encode genetic instructions (like DNA), and some RNAs can carry out chemical reactions (like proteins). Therefore, it solves the chicken-and-egg problem of which of these two molecules came first. Other evidence also suggests that RNA may be the most ancient of the organic molecules.

How do you make complex cells? You start with simple ones. The first cells were most likely primitive prokaryotic-like cells, even more simplistic than these E. coli bacteria. The first cells were probably no more than organic compounds, such as a simplistic RNA, surrounded by a membrane. Was it a phospholipid bilayer membrane? Probably not —it was likely a simplistic membrane able to separate the inside from the outside. Over time, as other organic compounds such as DNA and proteins developed, cells also evolved into more complex structures. Once a cell was able to be stable, reproduce itself, and pass its genetic information to the next generation, then there was life. 
The  First  Cells 	  What was needed for the first cell? Some sort of membrane surrounding organic molecules? Probably. How organic molecules such as RNA developed into cells is not known for certain. Scientists speculate that lipid membranes grew around the organic molecules. The membranes prevented the molecules from reacting with other molecules, so they did not form new compounds. In this way, the organic molecules persisted, and the first cells may have formed. Figure 5.7 shows a model of the hypothetical first cell. Were these first cells the first living organisms? Were they able to live and reproduce while passing their genetic information to the next generation? If so, then yes, these first cells could be considered the first living organisms. 
Hypothetical  First  Cell.  The earliest cells 	  may have consisted of little more than RNA inside a lipid membrane. 
 	  No doubt there were many early cells of this type. However, scientists think that only one early cell (or group of cells) eventually gave rise to all subsequent life on Earth. That one cell is called the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). It probably existed around 3.5 billion years ago. LUCA was one of the earliest prokaryotic cells. It would have lacked a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. To learn more about LUCA and universal common descent, you can watch the video at the following link: URL . 
Photosynthesis and  Cellular  Respiration 	  The earliest cells were probably heterotrophs. Most likely they got their energy from other molecules in the organic “soup.” However, by about 3 billion years ago, a new way of obtaining energy evolved. This new way was photosynthesis. Through photosynthesis, organisms could use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water. These organisms were the first autotrophs. They provided food for themselves and for other organisms that began to consume them. After photosynthesis evolved, oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere. This has been dubbed the “oxygen catastrophe.” Why? Oxygen was toxic to most early cells because they had evolved in its absence. As a result, many of them died out. The few that survived evolved a new way to take advantage of the oxygen. This second major innovation was cellular respiration. It allowed cells to use oxygen to obtain more energy from organic molecules. 
Summary 	  • The first cells consisted of little more than an organic molecule such as RNA inside a lipid membrane. • One cell (or group of cells), called the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), gave rise to all subsequent life on Earth. • Photosynthesis evolved by 3 billion years ago and released oxygen into the atmosphere. • Cellular respiration evolved after that to make use of the oxygen. Use the time slider in this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Evolution at URL . • Summarize the endosymbiotic theory. • Provide evidence for the endosymbiotic theory. Why can this fish live in these tentacles, but other fish cannot? Anemones and Clown Fish have a well-known symbiotic relationship. In the ocean, the Clown Fish are protected from predator fish by the stinging tentacles of the anemone, and the anemone receives protection from polyp-eating fish, which the Clown Fish chases away. But what about symbiotic relationships at a much smaller scale? Is it possible for two single-celled organisms to have a symbiotic relationship? As you will find out, yes it is! 
Evolution of  Eukaryotes 	  Our own eukaryotic cells protect DNA in chromosomes with a nuclear membrane, make ATP with mitochondria, move with flagella (in the case of sperm cells), and feed on cells which make our food with chloroplasts. All multicellular organisms and the unicellular Protists share this cellular intricacy. Bacterial (prokaryotic) cells are orders of magnitude smaller and have none of this complexity. What quantum leap in evolution created this vast chasm of difference? The first eukaryotic cells cells with a nucleus an internal membrane-bound organelles probably evolved about came about when large cells engulfed small cells. The small cells were not digested by the large cells. Instead, they lived within the large cells and evolved into organelles. The large and small cells formed a symbiotic relationship in which both cells benefited. Some of the small cells were able to break down the large cell’s wastes for energy. They supplied energy not only to themselves but also to the large cell. They became the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. Other small cells were able to use sunlight to make food. They shared the food with the large cell. They became the chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells. 
From  Independent  Cell to  Organelle.  The 	  endosymbiotic theory explains how eukaryotic cells evolved. 
Mitochondria and  Chloroplasts 	  What is the evidence for this evolutionary pathway? Biochemistry and electron microscopy provide convincing support. The mitochondria and chloroplasts within our eukaryotic cells share the following features with prokaryotic cells: • Their organelle DNA is short and circular, and the DNA sequences do not match DNA sequences found in the nucleus. • Molecules that make up organelle membranes resemble those in prokaryotic membranes –and differ from those in eukaryotic membranes. • Ribosomes in these organelles are similar to those of bacterial ribosomes, and different from eukaryotic ribosomes. • Reproduction is by binary fission, not by mitosis. • Biochemical pathways and structures show closer relationships to prokaryotes. • Two or more membranes surround these organelles. The "host" cell membrane and biochemistry are more similar to those of Archaebacteria, so scientists believe eukaryotes descended more directly from that major group ( Figure 5.9). The timing of this dramatic evolutionary event (more likely a series of events) is not clear. The oldest fossil clearly related to modern eukaryotes is a red alga dating back to 1.2 billion years ago. However, many scientists place the appearance of eukaryotic cells at about Eukaryotes –became well established. What Does it all Mean? Eukaryotic cells, made possible by endosymbiosis, were powerful and efficient. That power and efficiency gave them the potential to evolve new characteristics: multicellularity, cell specialization, and large size. They were the key to the spectacular diversity of animals, plants, and fungi that populate our world today. Nevertheless, as we close the history of early life, reflect once more on the remarkable but often unsung patterns and processes of early evolution. Often, as humans, we focus our attention on plants and animals, and ignore bacteria. Our human senses cannot directly perceive the unimaginable variety of single cells, the architecture of organic molecules, or the intricacy of biochemical pathways. Let your study of early evolution give you a new perspective –a window into the beauty and diversity of unseen worlds, now and throughout Earth’s history. In addition to the mitochondria that call your 100 trillion cells home, your body contains more bacterial cells than human cells. You, mitochondria, and your resident bacteria share common ancestry –a continuous history of the gift of life. The three major domains of life had evolved by 1.5 billion years ago. Biochemical similarities show that eukaryotes share more recent common ancestors with the Archaea, but our organelles probably descended from bacteria by endosymbiosis. 
Summary 	  • Eukaryotic cells probably evolved about 2 billion years ago. Their evolution is explained by endosymbiotic theory. • Mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from prokaryotic organisms. • Eukaryotic cells would go on to evolve into the diversity of eukaryotes we know today.

What did early eukaryotic life look like? Some looked like this. This is a fossil of an ammonite. Ammonites are excellent index fossils, and it is often possible to link the rock layer in which they are found to specific geological time periods. 
Multicellular  Life:  Setting the  Stage 	  Nearly 80% of Earth’s history passed before multicellular life evolved. Up until then, all organisms existed as single cells. Why did multicellular organisms evolve? What led up to this major step in the evolution of life? To put the evolution of multicellularity in context, let’s return to what was happening on planet Earth during this part of its history. 
The  Late  Precambrian 	  The late Precambrian is the time from about 2 billion to half a billion years ago. During this long span of time, Earth experienced many dramatic geologic and climatic changes. • Continents drifted. They collided to form a gigantic supercontinent and then broke up again and moved apart. Continental drift changed climates worldwide and caused intense volcanic activity. To see an animation of continental drift, go to this link: URL . • Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rose and fell. This was due to volcanic activity and other factors. When the levels were high, they created a greenhouse effect. More heat was trapped on Earth’s surface, and the climate became warmer. When the levels were low, less heat was trapped and the planet cooled. Several times, cooling was severe enough to plunge Earth into an ice age. One ice age was so cold that snow and ice completely covered the planet. Earth during this ice age has been called snowball Earth (see Figure 5.10). Snowball Earth. During the late Precambrian, Earth grew so cold that it was covered with snow and ice. Earth during this ice age has been called snowball Earth. 
Life  During the  Late  Precambrian 	  The dramatic changes of the late Precambrian had a major impact on Earth’s life forms. Living things that could not adapt died out. They were replaced by organisms that evolved new adaptations. These adaptations included sexual reproduction, specialization of cells, and multicellularity. • Sexual reproduction created much more variety among offspring. This increased the chances that at least some of them would survive when the environment changed. It also increased the speed at which evolution could occur. • Some cells started to live together in colonies. In some colonies, cells started to specialize in doing different jobs. This made the cells more efficient as a colony than as individual cells. • By 1 billion years ago, the first multicellular organisms had evolved. They may have developed from colonies of specialized cells. Their cells were so specialized they could no longer survive independently. However, together they were mighty. They formed an organism that was bigger, more efficient, and able to do much more than any single-celled organism ever could. 
The  Precambrian  Extinction 	  At the close of the Precambrian 544 million years ago, a mass extinction occurred. In a mass extinction, many or even most species abruptly disappear from Earth. There have been five mass extinctions in Earth’s history. Many scientists think we are currently going through a sixth mass extinction. What caused the Precambrian mass extinction? A combination of climatic and geologic events was probably responsible. No matter what the cause, the extinction paved the way for a burst of new life, called the Cambrian explosion, during the following Paleozoic Era. 
Summary 	  • During the late Precambrian, continents drifted, carbon dioxide levels fluctuated, and climates changed. Many organisms could not survive the changes and died out. • Other organisms evolved important new adaptations. These include sexual reproduction, cell specialization, and multicellularity. • The Precambrian ended with a mass extinction, which paved the way for the Cambrian explosion. Use the time slider in this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Evolution at URL . • Define Cambrian explosion and Permian extinction. • Give an overview of life during the six periods of the Paleozoic Era. What was early life like? Prehistoric underwater life exploded with amazing new creatures during the Paleozoic Era. Evolution allowed life to take many diverse forms, eventually developing the necessary adaptations to move from the ocean onto land. 
Life  During the  Paleozoic 	  The Paleozoic Era is literally the era of “old life.” It lasted from 544 to 245 million years ago and is divided into six periods. Major events in each period of the Paleozoic Era are described in Figure 5.11. The era began with a spectacular burst of new life. This is called the Cambrian explosion. The era ended with the biggest mass extinction the world had ever seen. This is known as the Permian extinction. At the following link, you can watch a video about these and other events of the Paleozoic Era: URL . 
The  Paleozoic  Era 	  The Cambrian Period: Following the Precambrian mass extinction, there was an explosion of new kinds of organisms in the Cambrian Period (544–505 million years ago). Many types of primitive animals called sponges evolved. Small ocean invertebrates called trilobites became abundant. The Ordovician Period: During the next period, the Ordovician Period (505–440 million years ago), the oceans became filled with invertebrates of many types. Also during this period, the first fish evolved and plants colonized the land for the first time. But animals still remained in the water. The Silurian Period: During the Silurian Period (440–410 million years ago), corals appeared in the oceans, and fish continued to evolve. On land, vascular plants appeared. With special tissues to circulate water and other materials, these plants could grow larger than the earlier nonvascular plants. The Paleozoic Era includes the six periods described here. The Devonian Period: During the Devonian Period (410–360 million years ago), the first seed plants evolved. Seeds have a protective coat and stored food to help these plants survive. Seed plants eventually became the most common type of land plants. In the oceans, fish with lobe fins evolved. They could breathe air when they raised their heads above water. Breathing would be necessary for animals to eventually colonize the land. The Carboniferous Period: Next, during the Carboniferous Period (360–290 million years ago), widespread forests of huge plants left massive deposits of carbon that eventually turned to coal. The first amphibians evolved to move out of the water and colonize land, but they had to return to the water to reproduce. Soon after amphibians arose, the first reptiles evolved. They were the first animals that could reproduce on dry land. The Permian Period: During the Permian Period (290–245 million years ago), all the major land masses collided to form a supercontinent called Pangaea. Temperatures were extreme, and the climate was dry. Plants and animals evolved adaptations to dryness, such as waxy leaves or leathery skin to prevent water loss. The Permian Period

The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of today’s continents in a single land mass. This configuration limited shallow coastal areas which harbor marine species, and may have contributed to the dramatic event which ended the 
Permian - the most massive extinction 	  ever recorded. In the mass extinction that ended the Permian, the majority of species went extinct. Many hypotheses have been offered to explain why this mass extinction occurred. These include huge meteorites striking Earth and enormous volcanoes spewing ashes and gases into the atmosphere. Both could have darkened the skies with dust for many months. This, in turn, would have shut down photosynthesis and cooled the planet. Despite the great loss of life, there was light at the end of the tunnel. The Permian extinction paved the way for another burst of new life at the start of the following Mesozoic Era. This included the evolution of the dinosaurs.

Plants, amphibians, and reptiles also moved to the land.

What exactly is a dinosaur? Two dinosaurs wade through shallow waters to get to the vegetation on this island. The Mesozoic Era is the age of dinosaurs. These animals grew so large they dominated the planet. Dinosaurs were so dominant that it took a catastrophic, environment-changing event for mammals to be able to take over. 
Mesozoic  Era:  The  Age of  Dinosaurs 	  The Mesozoic Era is literally the era of “middle life.” It is also known as the age of dinosaurs. It lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago and is divided into the three periods described in Figure 5.16. The Mesozoic began with the supercontinent Pangaea. Then, during the era, Pangaea broke up and the continents drifted apart. The movement of continents changed climates. It also caused tremendous volcanic activity. Mass extinctions occurred at the end of the Triassic and Cretaceous Periods. The first extinction paved the way for a dinosaur takeover. In the second extinction, the dinosaurs finally disappeared. At the link below, you can watch a video about these and other exciting events during the age of dinosaurs. URL The Triassic Period: During the Triassic Period (245–200 million years ago), the first dinosaurs branched off from the reptiles and colonized the land, air, and water. Huge seed ferns and conifers dominated the forests, and modern corals, fish, and insects evolved. The supercontinent Pangaea started to separate into Laurasia (today’s Northern Hemisphere continents) and Gondwanaland (today’s Southern Hemisphere continents). The Triassic Period ended with a mass extinction. The Mesozoic Era consists of the three periods described here. The Jurassic Period: The next period, the Jurassic Period (200–145 million years ago), began after the mass extinction that ended the Triassic Period. This mass extinction allowed dinosaurs to flourish in the Jurassic Period. This was the golden age of dinosaurs. Also during the Jurassic, the earliest birds evolved from reptile ancestors, and all the major groups of mammals evolved, though individual mammals were still small in size. Flowering plants appeared for the first time, and new insects also evolved to pollinate the flowers. The continents continued to move apart, and volcanic activity was especially intense. The classic Steven Spielberg movie Jurassic Park realistically depicts some of the dinosaurs present during this period: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. The Cretaceous Period: During the Cretaceous Period (145–65 million years ago), dinosaurs reached their peak in size and distribution. Tyrannosaurus Rex, weighed at least 7 tons. By the end of the Cretaceous, the continents were close to their present locations. Earth’s overall climate was warm; even the poles lacked ice. The period ended with the dramatic extinction of the dinosaurs. What happened to the dinosaurs? Why did they go extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period? Some scientists think a comet or asteroid may have collided with Earth, causing skies to darken, photosynthesis to shut down, and climates to change. A collision was probably at least a contributing factor. Without the dinosaurs, there were many opportunities for new organisms to exploit in the next era, the Cenozoic. Which living things do you think took over where the dinosaurs left off? 
Summary 	  • The Mesozoic Era is the age of dinosaurs. They evolved from earlier reptiles to fill niches on land, in the water, and in the air. • Mammals also evolved but were small in size. • Flowering plants appeared for the first time. • Dinosaurs went extinct at the end of the Mesozoic. Use the time slider in this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Evolution at URL . • Summarize life during the two periods of the Cenozoic Era. • Outline the main evolutionary events of the Cenozoic Era. What allowed mammals to outlast the dinosaurs? With dinosaurs around, mammals could not thrive. It took a catastrophic event to rid the planet of dinosaurs. Luckily for mammals, the extinction of the dinosaurs left many opportunities for mammals to take over and flourish. 
The  Cenozoic  Era:  Age of  Mammals 	  The Cenozoic Era literally means the era of “modern life.” It is also called the age of mammals. Mammals took advantage of the extinction of the dinosaurs. They flourished and soon became the dominant animals on Earth. You can learn more about the evolution of mammals during the Cenozoic at the link below. The Cenozoic began 65 million years ago and continues to the present. It may be divided into the two periods described in Figure 5.17. http ://URL The Tertiary Period: During the Tertiary Period (65–1.8 million years ago), Earth’s climate was generally warm and humid. This allowed mammals to evolve further and fill virtually all niches vacated by the dinosaurs. Many mammals increased in size. Mammals called primates evolved, including human ancestors. Modern rain forests and grasslands appeared, and flowering plants and insects were numerous and widespread. The Quaternary Period: During the Quaternary Period (1.8 million years ago–present), Earth’s climate cooled, leading to a series of ice ages. Sea levels fell because so much water was frozen in glaciers. This created land bridges between continents, allowing land animals to move to new areas. Some mammals, like the woolly mammoths adapted to the cold by evolving very large size and thick fur. Other animals moved closer to the equator or went extinct, along with many plants. 
One way of dividing the  Cenozoic  Era is 	  into the two periods described here. The last ice age ended about 12,000 years ago. By that time, our own species, Homo sapiens, had evolved. After that, we were witnesses to the unfolding of life’s story. Although we don’t know all the details of the recent past, it is far less of a mystery than the billions of years that preceded it. ”Walking With Cavemen” is an excellent depiction of the evolution of our species, from Lucy, the first upright ape, to her ancestors millions of years later. See URL for additional information. 
D:  The  Last  Ice  Age 	  Imagine a vast grassy ecosystem covered with herds of elephants, bison, and camels stretching as far as the eye can see. Africa? Maybe. But this also describes Northern California at the end of the last Ice Age. What happened to all this wildlife? Were they over-hunted and killed off? Did global warming destroy their populations? Scientists are not sure, but this relatively recent loss of life does raise many interesting questions.

Summary 	  • The Cenozoic Era is the age of mammals. They evolved to fill virtually all the niches vacated by dinosaurs. • The ice ages of the Quaternary Period of the Cenozoic led to many extinctions. • The last ice age ended 12,000 years ago.

In biology, what would classification refer to? There are millions and millions of species, so classifying organisms into proper categories can be a difficult task. To make it easier for all scientists to do, a classification system had to be developed. 
Linnaean  Classification 	  The evolution of life on Earth over the past 4 billion years has resulted in a huge variety of species. For more than is called taxonomy. Classification is an important step in understanding the present diversity and past evolutionary history of life on Earth. All modern classification systems have their roots in the Linnaean classification system. 
It was developed by 	  Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus in the 1700s. He tried to classify all living things that were known at his time. He grouped together organisms that shared obvious physical traits, such as number of legs or shape of leaves. For his contribution, Linnaeus is known as the “father of taxonomy.” You can learn more about Linnaeus and his system of classification by watching the video at this link: URL . The Linnaean system of classification consists of a hierarchy of groupings, called taxa (singular, taxon). Taxa range from the kingdom to the species (see Figure 5.18). The kingdom is the largest and most inclusive grouping. It consists of organisms that share just a few basic similarities. Examples are the plant and animal kingdoms. The species is the smallest and most exclusive grouping. It consists of organisms that are similar enough to produce fertile offspring together. Closely related species are grouped together in a genus. Linnaean Classification System: Classification of the Human Species. This chart shows the taxa of the Linnaean classification system. Each taxon is a subdivision of the taxon below it in the chart. For example, a species is a subdivision of a genus. The classification of humans is given in the chart as an example. 
Binomial  Nomenclature 	  Perhaps the single greatest contribution Linnaeus made to science was his method of naming species. This method, called binomial nomenclature, gives each species a unique, two-word Latin name consisting of the genus name and the species name. An example is Homo sapiens, the two-word Latin name for humans. It literally means “wise human.” This is a reference to our big brains. Why is having two names so important? It is similar to people having a first and a last name. You may know several people with the first name Michael, but adding Michael’s last name usually pins down exactly whom you mean. In the same way, having two names uniquely identifies a species. 
Revisions in  Linnaean  Classification 	  Linnaeus published his classification system in the 1700s. Since then, many new species have been discovered. The biochemistry of many organisms has also become known. Eventually, scientists realized that Linnaeus’s system of classification needed revision. A major change to the Linnaean system was the addition of a new taxon called the domain. A domain is a taxon that is larger and more inclusive than the kingdom. Most biologists agree there are three domains of life on Earth: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota (see Figure below). Both Bacteria and Archaea consist of single-celled prokaryotes. Eukaryota consists of all eukaryotes, from single-celled protists to humans. This domain includes the Animalia (animals), Plantae (plants), Fungi (fungi), and Protista (protists) kingdoms. This phylogenetic tree is based on comparisons of ribosomal RNA base sequences among living organisms. The tree divides all organisms into three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. 
Humans and other animals belong to the 	  Eukarya domain. From this tree, organisms that make up the domain Eukarya appear to have shared a more recent common ancestor with Archaea than Bacteria. 
Summary 	  • Classification is an important step in understanding life on Earth. • All modern classification systems have their roots in the Linnaean classification system. • The Linnaean system is based on similarities in obvious physical traits. It consists of a hierarchy of taxa, from the kingdom to the species. • Each species is given a unique two-word Latin name. • The recently added domain is a larger and more inclusive taxon than the kingdom.

Identify the groupings that correspond to the different taxa in the Linnaean system. • Define clade. • Describe phylogenetic classification. • Interpret a phylogenetic tree and cladogram. • Distinguish phylogenetic classification from Linnaean classification. Can two different species be related? Of course they can. For example, there are many different species of mammals, or of one type of mammal, such as mice. And they are all related. In other words, how close or how far apart did they separate from a common ancestor during evolution? Determining how different species are evolutionarily related can be a tremendous task. 
Phylogenetic  Classification 	  Linnaeus classified organisms based on obvious physical traits. Basically, organisms were grouped together if they looked alike. After Darwin published his theory of evolution in the 1800s, scientists looked for a way to classify organisms that showed phylogeny. Phylogeny is the evolutionary history of a group of related organisms. It is represented by a phylogenetic tree, like the one in Figure 5.20. One way of classifying organisms that shows phylogeny is by using the clade. A clade is a group of organisms that includes an ancestor and all of its descendants. Clades are based on cladistics. This is a method of comparing traits 
Phylogenetic  Tree.  This phylogenetic tree 	  shows how three hypothetical species are related to each other through common ancestors. Do you see why Species 1 and than either is to Species 3? in related species to determine ancestor-descendant relationships. Clades are represented by cladograms, like the one in Figure 5.21. This cladogram represents the mammal and reptile clades. The reptile clade includes birds. It shows that birds evolved from reptiles. Linnaeus classified mammals, reptiles, and birds in separate classes. This masks their evolutionary relationships. This cladogram classifies mammals, reptiles, and birds in clades based on their evolutionary relationships. 
Summary 	  • Phylogeny is the evolutionary history of group of related organisms. It is represented by a phylogenetic tree that shows how species are related to each other through common ancestors. • A clade is a group of organisms that includes an ancestor and all of its descendants. It is a phylogenetic classification, based on evolutionary relationships.

What’s that big red pouch? The Frigate bird of the Galápagos Islands. This bird can be found throughout the tropical Atlantic down to the Galápagos Islands and Ecuador, but not in Europe or South America, so Darwin may never have come across one until he landed on the Galápagos. Such a unique creature was bound to make a naturalist such as Darwin wonder why. Why do they look the way they do? What’s that big red pouch? What are the advantages? 
Darwin’s  Theory 	  The Englishman Charles Darwin is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived. His place in the history of science is well deserved. Darwin’s theory of evolution represents a giant leap in human understanding. It explains and unifies all of biology. An overview of evolution can be seen at URL (17:39). Click image to the left or use the URL below. As you view Introduction to Evolution and Natural Selection, focus on the following concepts: Darwin’s theory of evolution actually contains two major ideas: descendants diverged from common ancestors in the past. living things with beneficial traits producing more offspring than others. This results in changes in the traits of living things over time. In Darwin’s day, most people believed that all species were created at the same time and remained unchanged thereafter. They also believed that Earth was only about 6,000 years old. Therefore, Darwin’s ideas revolutionized biology. How did Darwin come up with these important ideas? It all started when he went on a voyage. 
The  Voyage of the 	  In 1831, when Darwin was just 22 years old, he set sail on a scientific expedition on a ship called the HMS Beagle. He was the naturalist on the voyage. As a naturalist, it was his job to observe and collect specimens of plants, animals, rocks, and fossils wherever the expedition went ashore. The route the ship took and the stops they made are shown in the Figure 5.22. You can learn more about Darwin’s voyage at this link: URL oyage/voyage03.html . Darwin was fascinated by nature, so he loved his job on the Beagle. He spent more than 3 years of the 5-year trip exploring nature on distant continents and islands. While he was away, a former teacher published Darwin’s accounts of his observations. By the time Darwin finally returned to England, he had become famous as a naturalist. 
Darwin’s  Observations 	  During the long voyage, Darwin made many observations that helped him form his theory of evolution. For example: • He visited tropical rainforests and other new habitats where he saw many plants and animals he had never seen before (see Figure 5.23). This impressed him with the great diversity of life. • He experienced an earthquake that lifted the ocean floor 2.7 meters (9 feet) above sea level. He also found rocks containing fossil sea shells in mountains high above sea level. These observations suggested that continents and oceans had changed dramatically over time and continue to change in dramatic ways. • He visited rock ledges that had clearly once been beaches that had gradually built up over time. This suggested that slow, steady processes also change Earth’s surface. • He dug up fossils of gigantic extinct mammals, such as the ground sloth (see Figure 5.23). This was hard evidence that organisms looked very different in the past. It suggested that living things—like Earth’s surface—change over time. 
The  Galápagos  Islands 	  Darwin’s most important observations were made on the Galápagos Islands (see map in Figure 5.24). This is a group of 16 small volcanic islands 966 kilometers (600 miles) off the west coast of Ecuador, South America. Voyage of the Beagle. This map shows the route of Darwin’s 5-year voyage on the HMS Beagle. Each stop along the way is labeled. Darwin and the others on board eventually circled the globe. On his voyage, Darwin saw giant marine iguanas and blue-footed boobies. He also dug up the fossil skeleton of a giant ground sloth like the one shown here. From left: Giant Marine Iguana, Blue-Footed Boobies, and Fossil 
Galápagos  Islands.  This map shows the 	  location of the Galápagos Islands that Darwin visited on his voyage. Individual Galápagos islands differ from one another in important ways. Some are rocky and dry. Others have better soil and more rainfall. Darwin noticed that the plants and animals on the different islands also differed. For example, the giant tortoises on one island had saddle-shaped shells, while those on another island had dome-shaped shells (see Darwin thinking about the origin of species. He wondered how each island came to have its own type of tortoise. The Farallon Islands – "California’s Galapagos" One of the most productive marine food webs on the planet is located on the Farallon Islands, just 28 miles off the San Francisco, California coast. These islands also host the largest seabird breeding colony in the continental United States, with over 300,000 breeding seabirds. The islands are known as the Galapagos of California. Why?

Summary 	  • Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection states that living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring than others do. This produces changes in the traits of living things over time. Galápagos Tortoises. Galápagos tortoises have differently shaped shells depending on which island they inhabit. Tortoises with saddle-shaped shells can reach up to eat plant leaves above their head. Tortoises with domeshaped shells cannot reach up in this way. These two types of tortoises live on islands with different environments and food sources. How might this explain the differences in their shells? • During his voyage on the Beagle, Darwin made many observations that helped him develop his theory of evolution. • Darwin’s most important observations were made on the Galápagos Islands.

How do structures like this form? Cathedral Rock in Sedona, Arizona. Though Arizona was not on Darwin’s itinerary, the work of others that saw and studied Earth’s changing landscape influenced him. One geologist, Charles Lyell, proposed that gradual geological processes have shaped Earth’s surface, inferring that Earth must be far older than most people believed. How else could structures like those shown here develop? If in fact Earth was much older then just 6,000 years, Darwin believed there would have been plenty of time for evolution to occur. 
Influences on  Darwin 	  Science, like evolution, always builds on the past. Darwin didn’t develop his theory completely on his own. He was influenced by the ideas of earlier thinkers. 
Earlier  Thinkers  Who  Influenced  Darwin 	  propose that species change over time. However, Lamarck was wrong about how species change. His idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics is incorrect. Traits an organism develops during its own life time cannot be passed on to offspring, as Lamarck believed. Geology, with him on the Beagle. In the book, Lyell argued that gradual geological processes have gradually shaped Earth’s surface. From this, Lyell inferred that Earth must be far older than most people believed. 
In 	  the essay, Malthus argued that human populations grow faster than the resources they depend on. When populations become too large, famine and disease break out. In the end, this keeps populations in check by killing off the weakest members. 
Artificial  Selection 	  These weren’t the only influences on Darwin. He was also aware that humans could breed plants and animals to have useful traits. By selecting which animals were allowed to reproduce, they could change an organism’s traits. The pigeons in Figure 5.26 are good examples. Darwin called this type of change in organisms artificial selection. He used the word ”artificial” to distinguish it from natural selection. 
Artificial  Selection in  Pigeons.  Pigeon 	  hobbyists breed pigeons to have certain characteristics. Both of the pigeons in the bottom row were bred from the common rock pigeon. 
Wallace’s  Theory 	  Did you ever hear the saying that “great minds think alike?” It certainly applies to Charles Darwin and another English naturalist named Alfred Russel Wallace. Wallace lived at about the same time as Darwin. He also traveled to distant places to study nature. Wallace wasn’t as famous as Darwin. However, he developed basically the same theory of evolution. While working in distant lands, Wallace sent Darwin a paper he had written. In the paper, Wallace explained his evolutionary theory. This served to confirm what Darwin already thought.

Darwin’s  Theory of  Evolution by  Natural  Selection 	  Darwin spent many years thinking about the work of Lamarck, Lyell, and Malthus, what he had seen on his voyage, and artificial selection. What did all this mean? How did it all fit together? It fits together in Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection. It’s easy to see how all of these influences helped shape Darwin’s ideas. For a discussion of the underlying causes of natural selection and evolution see URL uArVnT1i-E (19:51). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Evolution of  Darwin’s  Theory 	  It took Darwin years to form his theory of evolution by natural selection. His reasoning went like this: of that. to produce the great diversity of life Darwin had observed. offspring” led to a “struggle for existence,” in Darwin’s words. be inherited. In nature, offspring with certain variations might be more likely to survive the “struggle for existence” and reproduce. If so, they would pass their favorable variations to their offspring. Nature selects the variations that are most useful. Therefore, he called this type of selection natural selection. could also change species over time. In fact, he thought that if a species changed enough, it might evolve into a new species. Wallace’s paper not only confirmed Darwin’s ideas. It also pushed him to finish his book, On the Origin of Species. Published in 1859, this book changed science forever. It clearly spelled out Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and provided convincing arguments and evidence to support it. 
Applying  Darwin’s  Theory 	  The following example applies Darwin’s theory. It explains how giraffes came to have such long necks (see Figure • In the past, giraffes had short necks. But there was chance variation in neck length. Some giraffes had necks a little longer than the average. • Then, as now, giraffes fed on tree leaves. Perhaps the environment changed, and leaves became scarcer. There would be more giraffes than the trees could support. Thus, there would be a “struggle for existence.” • Giraffes with longer necks had an advantage. They could reach leaves other giraffes could not. Therefore, the long-necked giraffes were more likely to survive and reproduce. They had greater fitness. • These giraffes passed the long-neck trait to their offspring. Each generation, the population contained more long-necked giraffes. Eventually, all giraffes had long necks. As this example shows, chance variations may help a species survive if the environment changes. Variation among species helps ensure that at least one will be able to survive environmental change.

D:  Chasing  Beetles,  Finding  Darwin 	  It’s been over 150 years since Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species. Yet his ideas remain as central to scientific exploration as ever, and has been called the unifying concept of all biology. Is evolution continuing today? Of course it is. Giraffes feed on leaves high in trees. 
Their long necks allow them to reach 	  leaves that other ground animals cannot. QUEST follows researchers who are still unlocking the mysteries of evolution, including entomologist David Kavanaugh of the California Academy of Sciences, who predicted that a new beetle species would be found on the 
Trinity  Alps of  Northern  California.  See http://www.kqed.org/quest/television/chasing-beetles-finding-darwin2 for 	  more information. It’s rare for a biologist to predict the discovery of a new species. For his prediction, Kavanaugh drew inspiration from Darwin’s own 1862 prediction. When Darwin observed an orchid from Madagascar with a foot-long nectar, he predicted that a pollinator would be found with a tongue long enough to reach the nectar inside the orchid’s very thin, elongated nectar ”pouch”, though he had never seen such a bird or insect. Darwin’s prediction was based on his finding that all species are related to each other and that some of them evolve together, developing similar adaptations. Darwin’s prediction came true in 1903, when a moth was discovered in Madagascar with a long, thin proboscis, which it uncurls to reach the nectar in the orchid’s nectar. In the process of feeding from the orchid, the moth serves as its pollinator. The moth was given the scientific name Xanthopan morganii praedicta, in honor of Darwin’s prediction.

Would this be evidence of evolution? Fossils, like this dinosaur fossil, provide evidence of species that lived in the past and have since gone extinct. In other words, these fossils are evidence of evolution. 
Fossil  Evidence 	  In his book On the Origin of Species, Darwin included evidence to show that evolution had taken place. He also made logical arguments to support his theory that evolution occurs by natural selection. Since Darwin’s time, much more evidence has been gathered. The evidence includes a huge number of fossils. It also includes more detailed knowledge of living things, right down to their DNA. Fossils are a window into the past. They provide clear evidence that evolution has occurred. Scientists who find and study fossils are called paleontologists. How do they use fossils to understand the past? Consider the example of the horse, shown in the Figure 5.28. The fossil record shows how the horse evolved. The oldest horse fossils show what the earliest horses were like. They were about the size of a fox, and they had four long toes. Other evidence shows they lived in wooded marshlands, where they probably ate soft leaves. Through time, the climate became drier, and grasslands slowly replaced the marshes. Later fossils show that horses changed as well. • They became taller, which would help them see predators while they fed in tall grasses. • They evolved a single large toe that eventually became a hoof. This would help them run swiftly and escape predators. Evolution of the horse. Fossil evidence, depicted by the skeletal fragments, demonstrates evolutionary milestones in this process. Notice the obvious is the transformation of the leg bones from having four distinct digits to that of today’s horse. • Their molars (back teeth) became longer and covered with cement. This would allow them to grind tough grasses and grass seeds without wearing out their teeth. Similar fossil evidence demonstrates the evolution of the whale, moving from the land into the sea.

Is this evidence of evolution? Take a close look at this gorilla hand. The similarities to a human hand are remarkable. Comparing anatomy, and characterizing the similarities and differences, provides evidence of evolution. 
Evidence from  Living  Species 	  Just as Darwin did many years ago, today’s scientists study living species to learn about evolution. They compare the anatomy, embryos, and DNA of modern organisms to understand how they evolved. 
Comparative  Anatomy 	  Comparative anatomy is the study of the similarities and differences in the structures of different species. Similar body parts may be homologies or analogies. Both provide evidence for evolution. Homologous structures are structures that are similar in related organisms because they were inherited from a common ancestor. These structures may or may not have the same function in the descendants. Figure 5.29 shows the hands of several different mammals. They all have the same basic pattern of bones. They inherited this pattern from a common ancestor. However, their forelimbs now have different functions. Analogous structures are structures that are similar in unrelated organisms. The structures are similar because they evolved to do the same job, not because they were inherited from a common ancestor. For example, the wings of bats and birds, shown in Figure 5.30, look similar on the outside. They also have the same function. However, wings The forelimbs of all mammals have the same basic bone structure. evolved independently in the two groups of animals. This is apparent when you compare the pattern of bones inside the wings. 
Comparative  Embryology 	  Comparative embryology is the study of the similarities and differences in the embryos of different species. Similarities in embryos are evidence of common ancestry. All vertebrate embryos, for example, have gill slits and tails. Most vertebrates, except for fish, lose their gill slits by adulthood. Some of them also lose their tail. In humans, the tail is reduced to the tail bone. Thus, similarities organisms share as embryos may be gone by adulthood. This is why it is valuable to compare organisms in the embryonic stage. See URL brary/04/2/pdf/l_042_03.pdf for additional information and a comparative diagram of human, monkey, pig, chicken and salamander embryos. 
Vestigial  Structures 	  Structures like the human tail bone and whale pelvis are called vestigial structures. Evolution has reduced their size because the structures are no longer used. The human appendix is another example of a vestigial structure. It is a tiny remnant of a once-larger organ. In a distant ancestor, it was needed to digest food. It serves no purpose in humans today. Why do you think structures that are no longer used shrink in size? Why might a full-sized, unused structure reduce an organism’s fitness? 
Wings of bats and birds serve the same 	  function. Look closely at the bones inside the wings. The differences show they developed from different ancestors. 
Comparing  	  Darwin could compare only the anatomy and embryos of living things. Today, scientists can compare their DNA. Similar DNA sequences are the strongest evidence for evolution from a common ancestor. More similarities in the DNA sequence is evidence for a closer evolutionary relationship. Look at the cladogram in the Figure 5.31. It shows how humans and apes are related based on their DNA sequences. Evolution and molecules are discussed at URL (3:52). 
Cladogram of  Humans and  Apes.  This 	  cladogram is based on DNA comparisons. 
It shows how humans are related 	  to apes by descent from common ancestors. Using various types of information to understand evolutionary relationships is discussed in the following videos: URL (3:38), URL (6:45), URL (10:51). 
D:  The  Reverse  Evolution  Machine 	  In search of the common ancestor of all mammals, University of California Santa Cruz scientist David Haussler is pulling a complete reversal. Instead of studying fossils, he’s comparing the genomes of living mammals to construct a map of our common ancestors’ DNA. He also specializes in studying the DNA of extinct animals, asking how the DNA has changed over millions of years to create today’s species. His technique, referred to as computational genomics, holds promise for providing a better picture of how life evolved. See URL sion/the-reverse-evolution-machine for more information.

Evidence from  Biogeography 	  Biogeography is the study of how and why plants and animals live where they do. It provides more evidence for evolution. Let’s consider the camel family as an example. 
Biogeography of  Camels:  An  Example 	  Today, the camel family includes different types of camels. They are shown in Figure 5.32. All of today’s camels are descended from the same camel ancestors. These ancestors lived in North America about a million years ago. Early North American camels migrated to other places. Some went to East Asia. They crossed a land bridge during the last ice age. A few of them made it all the way to Africa. Others went to South America. They crossed the Isthmus of Panama. Once camels reached these different places, they evolved independently. They evolved adaptations that suited them for the particular environment where they lived. Through natural selection, descendants of the original camel ancestors evolved the diversity they have today. Camel Migrations and Present-Day Variation. Members of the camel family now live in different parts of the world. They differ from one another in a number of traits. However, they share basic similarities. This is because they all evolved from a common ancestor. What differences and similarities do you see? 
Island  Biogeography 	  The biogeography of islands yields some of the best evidence for evolution. Consider the birds called finches that Darwin studied on the Galápagos Islands (see Figure 5.33). All of the finches probably descended from one bird that arrived on the islands from South America. Until the first bird arrived, there had never been birds on the islands. The first bird was a seed eater. It evolved into many finch species. Each species was adapted for a different type of food. This is an example of adaptive radiation. This is the process by which a single species evolves into many new species to fill available niches. 
Eyewitness to  Evolution 	  In the 1970s, biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant went to the Galápagos Islands. They wanted to re-study Darwin’s finches. They spent more than 30 years on the project. Their efforts paid off. They were able to observe evolution by natural selection actually taking place. While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure 5.34). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. 
Summary 	  • Biogeography is the study of how and why plants and animals live where they do. It also provides evidence for evolution. 
Galápagos finches differ in beak size and 	  shape, depending on the type of food they eat. 
Finches.  The top graph shows the beak 	  sizes of the entire finch population studied by the Grants in 1976. The bottom graph shows the beak sizes of the survivors in 1978.

Jeans vs. Genes. What’s the difference? Plenty. One you have for life, the other just lasts a few years. One is the basis for the passing of traits from one generation to the next. Some jeans you change frequently. But what happens when you change a gene’s frequency? Essentially, evolution is a change in gene frequencies within a population. 
Genes in  Populations 	  Darwin knew that heritable variations are needed for evolution to occur. However, he knew nothing about Mendel’s laws of genetics. Mendel’s laws were rediscovered in the early 1900s. Only then could scientists fully understand the process of evolution. We now know that variations of traits are heritable. These variations are determined by different alleles. We also know that evolution is due to a change in alleles over time. How long a time? That depends on the scale of evolution. • Microevolution occurs over a relatively short period of time within a population or species. The Grants observed this level of evolution in Darwin’s finches (see the "Biogeography" concept). • Macroevolution occurs over geologic time above the level of the species. The fossil record reflects this level of evolution. It results from microevolution taking place over many generations. Remember that individuals do not evolve. Their genes do not change over time. The unit of evolution is the population. A population consists of organisms of the same species that live in the same area. In terms of evolution, the population is assumed to be a relatively closed group. This means that most mating takes place within the population. The science that focuses on evolution within populations is population genetics. It is a combination of evolutionary theory and Mendelian genetics. 
Gene  Pool 	  The genetic makeup of an individual is the individual’s genotype. A population consists of many genotypes. Altogether, they make up the population’s gene pool. The gene pool consists of all the genes of all the members of the population. For each gene, the gene pool includes all the different alleles for the gene that exist in the population. For a given gene, the population is characterized by the frequency of the different alleles in the gene pool. 
Allele  Frequencies 	  Allele frequency is how often an allele occurs in a gene pool relative to the other alleles for that gene. Look at the example in the Table 5.3. The population in the table has 100 members. In a sexually reproducing species, each member of the population has two copies of each gene. Therefore, the total number of copies of each gene in the gene pool is 200. The gene in the example exists in the gene pool in two forms, alleles A and a. Knowing the genotypes of each population member, we can count the number of alleles of each type in the gene pool. The table shows how this is done. 
Aa 	  aa 
Number of  Individuals 	  in the Population with that Genotype Number of Allele A Contributed to the Gene 
Pool by that  Genotype 	  Number of Allele a Contributed to the Gene 
Pool by that  Genotype 	  Let the letter p stand for the frequency of allele A. Let the letter q stand for the frequency of allele a. We can calculate p and q as follows: • p = number of A alleles/total number of alleles = 140/200 = 0.7 • q = number of a alleles/total number of alleles = 60/200 = 0.3 • Notice that p + q = 1. Evolution occurs in a population when allele frequencies change over time. What causes allele frequencies to change? That question was answered by Godfrey Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg in 1908 (see the Hardy-Weinberg Theorem concept). 
Summary 	  • Microevolution occurs over a short period of time in a population or species. Macroevolution occurs over geologic time above the level of the species. • The population is the unit of evolution. • A population’s gene pool consists of all the genes of all the members of the population. • For a given gene, the population is characterized by the frequency of different alleles in the gene pool.

Why is balance important? To these individuals, the importance of maintaining balance is obvious. If balance, or equilibrium, is maintained within a population’s genes, can evolution occur? No. But maintaining this type of balance today is difficult. 
The  Hardy- Weinberg  Theorem 	  Godfrey Hardy was an English mathematician. Wilhelm Weinberg was a German doctor. Each worked alone to come up with the founding principle of population genetics. Today, that principle is called the Hardy-Weinberg theorem. It shows that allele frequencies do not change in a population if certain conditions are met. Such a population is said to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The conditions for equilibrium are: passing their genes to the next generation. When all these conditions are met, allele frequencies stay the same. Genotype frequencies also remain constant. In addition, genotype frequencies can be expressed in terms of allele frequencies, as the Table 5.4 shows. For a further explanation of this theorem, see Solving Hardy Weinberg Problems at URL nK20kw . Hardy and Weinberg used mathematics to describe an equilibrium population (p = frequency of A, q = frequency of a, so p + q = 1): p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1. Using the genotype frequencies shown in Table 5.4, if p = 0.4, what is the frequency of the AA genotype?

Summary 	  • The Hardy-Weinberg theorem states that, if a population meets certain conditions, it will be in equilibrium. • In an equilibrium population, allele and genotype frequencies do not change over time. • The conditions that must be met are no mutation, no migration, very large population size, random mating, and no natural selection.

Because these are the only two alleles for this gene, p + q = 1.0. If the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals (aa) is 0.04, what is the value of q? What is the value of p? • List processes that change gene frequencies of a population. • Describe how mutations alter allele frequencies. • Define gene flow. • Explain genetic drift. • Compare the bottleneck effect to the founder effect. How do a population’s genes change? Remember, without change, there cannot be evolution. Together, the forces that change a population’s gene frequencies are the driving mechanisms behind evolution. 
Forces of  Evolution 	  The conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are unlikely to be met in real populations. The Hardy-Weinberg theorem also describes populations in which allele frequencies are not changing. By definition, such populations are not evolving. How does the theorem help us understand evolution in the real world? From the theorem, we can infer factors that cause allele frequencies to change. These factors are the "forces of evolution." There are four such forces: mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. Natural selection will be discussed in the "Natural Selection" concept. 
Mutation 	  Mutation creates new genetic variation in a gene pool. It is how all new alleles first arise. In sexually reproducing species, the mutations that matter for evolution are those that occur in gametes. Only these mutations can be passed to offspring. For any given gene, the chance of a mutation occurring in a given gamete is very low. Thus, mutations alone do not have much effect on allele frequencies. However, mutations provide the genetic variation needed for other forces of evolution to act. 
Gene  Flow 	  Gene flow occurs when individuals move into or out of a population. If the rate of migration is high, this can have a significant effect on allele frequencies. The allele frequencies of both the population they leave and the population they enter may change. During the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s, many American servicemen had children with Vietnamese women. Most of the servicemen returned to the United States after the war. However, they left copies of their genes behind in their offspring. In this way, they changed the allele frequencies in the Vietnamese gene pool. Was the gene pool of the American population also affected? Why or why not? 
Genetic  Drift 	  Genetic drift is a random change in allele frequencies that occurs in a small population. When a small number of parents produce just a few offspring, allele frequencies in the offspring may differ, by chance, from allele frequencies in the parents. This is like tossing a coin. If you toss a coin just a few times, you may, by chance, get more or less than the expected expected in the next generation. In this way, allele frequencies may drift over time. There are two special conditions under which genetic drift occurs. They are called bottleneck effect and founder effect. natural disaster such as a forest fire. By chance, allele frequencies of the survivors may be different from those of the original population. of the founders may be different from allele frequencies of the population they left. An example is described in the Figure 5.35.

What’s fitness? Does this type of fitness have anything to do with natural selection? Usually not. There are countless ways in which an organism can be more "fit," or better adapted to its habitat. And we probably do not know about most of these adaptations. 
Natural  Selection 	  Natural selection occurs when there are differences in fitness among members of a population. As a result, some individuals pass more genes to the next generation. This causes allele frequencies to change. 
Sickle  Cell and  Natural  Selection 	  The example of sickle-cell anemia is described in the Figure 5.36 and Table 5.5. It shows how natural selection can keep a harmful allele in a gene pool. You can also watch a video about natural selection and sickle-cell anemia at this link: URL .

Greatly reduced fitness because of 	  sickle-cell anemia Here’s how natural selection can keep a harmful allele in a gene pool: • The allele (S) for sickle-cell anemia is a harmful autosomal recessive. It is caused by a mutation in the normal allele (A) for hemoglobin (a protein on red blood cells). • Malaria is a deadly tropical disease. It is common in many African populations. • Heterozygotes (AS) with the sickle-cell allele are resistant to malaria. Therefore, they are more likely to survive and reproduce. This keeps the S allele in the gene pool. The sickle-cell example shows that fitness depends on phenotypes. It also shows that fitness may depend on the environment. What do you think might happen if malaria was eliminated in an African population with a relatively high frequency of the S allele? How might the fitness of the different genotypes change? How might this affect the frequency of the S allele? 
Natural  Selection and  Polygenic  Traits 	  Sickle-cell trait is controlled by a single gene. Natural selection for polygenic traits is more complex, unless you just look at phenotypes. Three ways that natural selection can affect phenotypes are shown in Figure 5.37. You can also watch an animation comparing the three ways at the link below. URL /chp23/2301s.swf . against. This narrows the range of variation. An example is human birth weight. Babies that are very large or very small at birth are less likely to survive. This keeps birth weight within a relatively narrow range. toward that extreme. This is the type of natural selection that the Grants observed in the beak size of Galápagos finches.

How can a river influence evolution? Imagine a group of small organisms, such as mice, that become separated by a mighty river. This group has now become isolated, and formed two separate groups. The groups are obviously no longer able to breed together. Over many generations, each group will evolve separately, eventually forming two completely new species of mice. 
Origin of  Species 	  Macroevolution is evolution over geologic time above the level of the species. One of the main topics in macroevolution is how new species arise. The process by which a new species evolves is called speciation. How does speciation occur? How does one species evolve into two or more new species? To understand how a new species forms, it’s important to review what a species is. A species is a group of organisms that can breed and produce fertile offspring together in nature. For a new species to arise, some members of a species must become reproductively isolated from the rest of the species. This means they can no longer interbreed with other members of the species. How does this happen? Usually they become geographically isolated first. 
Allopatric  Speciation 	  Assume that some members of a species become geographically separated from the rest of the species. If they remain separated long enough, they may evolve genetic differences. If the differences prevent them from interbreeding with members of the original species, they have evolved into a new species. Speciation that occurs in this way is called allopatric speciation. An example is described in the Figure 5.38. Allopatric Speciation in the Kaibab Squirrel. The Kaibab squirrel is in the process of becoming a new species. 
Sympatric  Speciation 	  Less often, a new species arises without geographic separation. This is called sympatric speciation. The following example shows one way this can occur. fruits. Both the flies and trees are native to the U.S. lay eggs in nearby apple trees. When the eggs hatched, the larvae fed on apples. reproductive isolation. Now they are reproductively isolated because they breed at different times. Their breeding season matches the season when the apple or hawthorn fruits mature. to be in the process of becoming separate species. Sympatric Speciation in Hawthorn Flies. Hawthorn flies are diverging from one species into two. As this example shows, behaviors as well as physical traits may evolve and lead to speciation. Isolating mechanisms are discussed in the following video URL (2:57). 
Summary 	  • New species arise in the process of speciation. • Allopatric speciation occurs when some members of a species become geographically separated. They then evolve genetic differences. If the differences prevent them from interbreeding with the original species, a new species has evolved. • Sympatric speciation occurs without geographic separation. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Speciation at URL . • Define coevolution. • Give an example of coevolution. How can a predator, such as a wolf, influence evolution? Wolves hunt caribou, chasing them down to capture them. The slower caribou are more likely to become lunch or dinner, leaving the faster individuals to reproduce. The resulting faster offspring will be even more difficult for the wolves to catch, and only the fastest wolves or perhaps the wolves who are genetically capable of developing methods to hunt very fast prey will get enough food to survive. This is coevolution in action. 
Coevolution 	  Evolution occurs in response to a change in the environment. Environmental change often involves other species of organisms. In fact, species in symbiotic relationships tend to evolve together. This is called coevolution. As one species changes, the other species must also change in order to adapt. Coevolution occurs in flowering plants and the species that pollinate them. The flower and bird in Figure 5.40 are a good example. They have evolved matching structures. In coevolution, relationships may be positive for one species or both, or may be an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey. Flowering plants depend on insects for pollination, so have evolved colors, shapes, scents, and even food supplies that are attractive to certain insect species. Insects, in turn, have evolved mouthparts, senses, and flight patterns that allow them to respond to and benefit from specific floral “offerings,” shown in the Figure 5.41. The endosymbiotic theory describes a special form of co-evolution: mitochondria and chloroplasts evolve within eukaryote cells, yet because these organelles have their own DNA sequence, different from that of the nucleus in the “host” cell, the organelle and host cell evolve in tandem –each influences the evolution of the other. 
Its  Pollinator.  The very long mouth part 	  of this hummingbird has coevolved with the tubular flower it pollinates. Only this species of bird can reach the nectar deep in the flower. What might happen to the flower if the bird species went extinct? Impressive proboscis and vivid colors! 
Hawk moths and the zinnias influence 	  each other’s evolution, because the flower depends on the moth for pollination, and the moth feeds on the flower. 
Summary 	  • Coevolution occurs when species evolve together. • Coevolution often happens in species that have symbiotic relationships. Examples include flowering plants and their pollinators. • See Coevolution at URL for a detailed summary.

Which is better, the direct route or the scenic route? Each has its advantages, depending on the situation. And that describes evolution. It can be fast or slow, depending on the situation. 
Timing of  Macroevolution 	  Is evolution slow and steady? Or does it occur in fits and starts? It may depend on what else is going on, such as changes in climate and geologic conditions. • When geologic and climatic conditions are stable, evolution may occur gradually. This is how Darwin thought evolution occurred. This model of the timing of evolution is called gradualism. • When geologic and climatic conditions are changing, evolution may occur more quickly. Thus, long periods of little change may be interrupted by bursts of rapid change. This model of the timing of evolution is called punctuated equilibrium. It is better supported by the fossil record than is gradualism. This model suggests that niches left open by sudden geologic and climatic changes may be rapidly filled by bursts of evolution. 
Summary 	  • Darwin thought that evolution occurs gradually. This model of evolution is called gradualism. • The fossil record better supports the model of punctuated equilibrium. In this model, long periods of little change are interrupted by bursts of rapid change. Two theories of evolutionary change gradualism vs. punctuated equilibrium are still debated. The former proposes continuous change, while the latter suggests that species remain constant for long periods of time and that change, when it occurs, is rapid.

These sponges are actually animals, although they are the simplest animals on Earth. Sponges are frequently used as shelter for small crabs, shrimps, and other invertebrates. 
Major  Trends in  Animal  Evolution 	  The oldest animal fossils are about 630 million years old. By 500 million years ago, most modern phyla of animals had evolved. Figure 5.43 shows when some of the major events in animal evolution took place. 
Partial  Geologic  Time  Scale.  This portion 	  of the geologic time scale shows major events in animal evolution. 
Animal  Origins 	  Who were the ancestors of the earliest animals? They may have been marine protists that lived in colonies. Scientists think that cells of some protist colonies became specialized for different jobs. After a while, the specialized cells came to need each other for survival. Thus, the first multicellular animal evolved. Look at the cells in Figure 5.44. One type of sponge cell, the choanocyte, looks a lot like the protist cell. How does this support the hypothesis that animals evolved from protists? 
Evolution of  Invertebrates 	  Many important animal adaptations evolved in invertebrates. Without these adaptations, vertebrates would not have been able to evolve. They include: • Tissues, organs, and organ systems. • A symmetrical body. • A brain and sensory organs. • A fluid-filled body cavity. • A complete digestive system. • A body divided into segments. 
Moving from  Water to  Land 	  When you think of the first animals to colonize the land, you may think of amphibians. It’s true that ancestors of amphibians were the first vertebrates to move to land. However, the very first animals to go ashore were invertebrates, most likely arthropods. 
Cells in  Sponges.  Sponge choanocytes 	  look a lot like choanoflagellate protists. The move to land required new adaptations. For example, animals needed a way to keep their body from drying out. They also needed a way to support their body on dry land without the buoyancy of water. One way early arthropods solved these problems was by evolving an exoskeleton. This is a non-bony skeleton that forms on the outside of the body. It supports the body and helps retain water. The ability to breath oxygen without gills was another necessary adaptation. The video "Walking with Monsters" is a depiction of the evolution of life from water onto land: URL ww.youtube.com/watch?v=gytrNU3iwvM (4:43). 
Evolution of  Chordates 	  Another major step in animal evolution was the evolution of a notochord. A notochord is a rigid rod that runs the length of the body. It supports the body and gives it shape (see Figure 5.45). It also provides a place for muscles to anchor, and counterbalances them when they contract. Animals with a notochord are called chordates. They also have a hollow nerve cord that runs along the top of the body. Gill slits and a tail are two other chordate features. Many modern chordates have some of these structures only as embryos. 
Evolution of  Vertebrates 	  Vertebrates evolved from primitive chordates. This occurred about 550 million years ago. The earliest vertebrates may have been jawless fish, like the hagfish in Figure 5.46. Vertebrates evolved a backbone to replace the notochord after the embryo stage. They also evolved a cranium, or bony skull, to enclose and protect the brain. As early vertebrates evolved, they became more complex. Around 365 million years ago, they finally made the transition from water to land. The first vertebrates to live on land were amphibians. They evolved from lobe-finned fish. You can compare a lobe-finned fish and an amphibian in Figure 5.47. 
Evolution of  Amniotes 	  Amphibians were the first animals to have true lungs and limbs for life on land. However, they still had to return to water to reproduce. That’s because their eggs lacked a waterproof covering and would dry out on land. The first Hagfish are very simple vertebrates. 
This tunicate is a primitive, deep-sea 	  chordate. is using its notochord to support its head, while it waits to snatch up prey in its big mouth. 
It 	  From Lobe-Finned Fish to Early Amphibian. 
Lobe-finned fish evolved into the 	  earliest amphibians. A lobe-finned fish could breathe air for brief periods of time. It could also use its fins to walk on land for short distances. What similarities do you see between the lobe-finned fish and the amphibian? fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes. Amniotes are animals that produce eggs with internal membranes. The membranes let gases but not water pass through. Therefore, in an amniotic egg, an embryo can breathe without drying out. Amniotic eggs were the first eggs that could be laid on land. The earliest amniotes evolved about 350 million years ago. They may have looked like the animal in Figure 5.48. Within a few million years, two important amniote groups evolved: synapsids and sauropsids. Synapsids evolved into mammals. The sauropsids gave rise to reptiles, dinosaurs, and birds. 
The earliest amniotes 	  Early Amniote. probably looked something like this. They were reptile-like, but not actually reptiles. Reptiles evolved somewhat later. 
Summary 	  • The earliest animals evolved from colonial protists more than 600 million years ago. • Many important animal adaptations evolved in invertebrates, including tissues and a brain. • The first animals to live on land were invertebrates. • Amphibians were the first vertebrates to live on land. • Amniotes were the first animals that could reproduce on land.

Summary 	  Evolution focuses on past life forms and how they turned into present life forms. The history of life on Earth demonstrates how the first cells formed, turned into simple life forms, and then became more complex plants and animals. The studies of Charles Darwin have reshaped and influenced all aspects of biology. The myriad evidence of evolution demonstrates the importance of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Lastly, the current focus on evolution demonstrates that evolution is a continuous and ongoing process that continues today.

Introduction 	  What do you get when you take energy, nutrients and other resources, biomes and their populations, and all the species and their relationships? You get ecology. Understanding ecology is in part understanding the biology of our planet. And it can easily be argued that this is especially important today. We literally hold the future of our planet in our hands. The lessons in the Ecology chapter discuss ecology and all the related aspects that comprise the ecosystem. • Define ecology and ecosystem. • Distinguish between abiotic and biotic factors. • Describe a niche and habitat. • Explain the competitive exclusion principle. What lives in the forest? Take a close look at this ecosystem. Obviously there are deer and many types of plants. But there are organisms that live there that cannot be seen in the picture. Many other animals, such as rabbits, mice, and countless insects. There are also bacteria and fungi. Add in the nonliving aspects of the area, such as the water, and you have an ecosystem. 
The  Ecosystem 	  Ecology is the study of how living things interact with each other and with their environment. It is a major branch of biology, but has areas of overlap with geography, geology, climatology, and other sciences. The study of ecology begins with two fundamental concepts in ecology: the ecosystem and their organisms. Organisms are individual living things. Despite their tremendous diversity, all organisms have the same basic needs: energy and matter. These must be obtained from the environment. Therefore, organisms are not closed systems. They depend on and are influenced by their environment. The environment includes two types of factors: abiotic and biotic. temperature, and water. of the same and different species. An ecosystem is a unit of nature and the focus of study in ecology. It consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area and their interactions. Ecosystems can vary in size. A lake could be considered an ecosystem. So could a dead log on a forest floor. Both the lake and log contain a variety of species that interact with each other and with abiotic factors. Another example of an ecosystem is pictured in Figure 6.1. 
A desert ecosystem.  What are some of 	  the biotic and abiotic factors in this desert ecosystem? When it comes to energy, ecosystems are not closed. They need constant inputs of energy. Most ecosystems get energy from sunlight. A small minority get energy from chemical compounds. Unlike energy, matter is not constantly added to ecosystems. Instead, it is recycled. Water and elements such as carbon and nitrogen are used over and over again. 
Niche 	  One of the most important concepts associated with the ecosystem is the niche. A niche refers to the role of a species in its ecosystem. It includes all the ways that the species interacts with the biotic and abiotic factors of the environment. Two important aspects of a species’ niche are the food it eats and how the food is obtained. Look at obtains the food in a different way. 
Habitat 	  Another aspect of a species’ niche is its habitat. The habitat is the physical environment in which a species lives and to which it is adapted. A habitat’s features are determined mainly by abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall. These factors also influence the traits of the organisms that live there. 
Competitive  Exclusion  Principle 	  A given habitat may contain many different species, but each species must have a different niche. Two different species cannot occupy the same niche in the same place for very long. This is known as the competitive exclusion principle. If two species were to occupy the same niche, what do you think would happen? They would compete 
Bird  Niches.  Each of these species of 	  birds has a beak that suits it for its niche. 
For example, the long slender beak of the 	  nectarivore allows it to sip liquid nectar from flowers. The short sturdy beak of the granivore allows it to crush hard, tough grains. with one another for the same food and other resources in the environment. Eventually, one species would be likely to outcompete and replace the other. 
Summary 	  • Ecology is the study of how living things interact with each other and with their environment. • The environment includes abiotic (nonliving) and biotic (living) factors. • An ecosystem consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area and their interactions. • A niche refers to the role of a species in its ecosystem. • A habitat is the physical environment in which a species lives and to which it is adapted. • Two different species cannot occupy the same niche in the same place for very long.

What is happening inside each leaf and blade of grass? Photosynthesis. Maybe the most important biochemical reaction of Earth. As sunlight shines down on this forest, the sunlight is being absorbed, and the energy from that sunlight is being transformed into chemical energy. That chemical energy is then distributed to all other living organisms in the ecosystem. 
Flow of  Energy 	  To survive, ecosystems need a constant influx of energy. Energy enters ecosystems in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds. Some organisms use this energy to make food. Other organisms get energy by eating the food. 
Producers 	  Producers are organisms that produce food for themselves and other organisms. They use energy and simple inorganic molecules to make organic compounds. The stability of producers is vital to ecosystems because all organisms need organic molecules. Producers are also called autotrophs. There are two basic types of autotrophs: photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs. certain bacteria (see Figure 6.3). some bacteria and also archaea. Archaea are microorganisms that resemble bacteria. Different types of photoautotrophs are important in different ecosystems. 
Consumers 	  Consumers are organisms that depend on other organisms for food. They take in organic molecules by essentially “eating” other living things. They include all animals and fungi. (Fungi don’t really “eat”; they absorb nutrients from other organisms.) They also include many bacteria and even a few plants, such as the pitcher plant shown in • Herbivores consume producers such as plants or algae. They are a necessary link between producers and other consumers. Examples include deer, rabbits, and mice. • Carnivores consume animals. Examples include lions, polar bears, hawks, frogs, salmon, and spiders. Carnivores that are unable to digest plants and must eat only animals are called obligate carnivores. Other carnivores can digest plants but do not commonly eat them. • Omnivores consume both plants and animals. They include humans, pigs, brown bears, gulls, crows, and some species of fish. 
Decomposers 	  When organisms die, they leave behind energy and matter in their remains. Decomposers break down the remains and other wastes and release simple inorganic molecules back to the environment. Producers can then use the Pitcher Plant. Virtually all plants are producers. This pitcher plant is an exception. 
It traps them in a sticky substance in 	  its “pitcher.” Then it secretes enzymes that break down the insects and release nutrients. Which type of consumer is a pitcher plant? It consumes insects. molecules to make new organic compounds. The stability of decomposers is essential to every ecosystem. Decomposers are classified by the type of organic matter they break down: • Scavengers consume the soft tissues of dead animals. Examples of scavengers include vultures, raccoons, and blowflies. • Detritivores consume detritus—the dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris that collects on the soil or at the bottom of a body of water. On land, detritivores include earthworms, millipedes, and dung beetles (see Figure 6.5). In water, detritivores include “bottom feeders” such as sea cucumbers and catfish. • Saprotrophs are the final step in decomposition. They feed on any remaining organic matter that is left after other decomposers do their work. Saprotrophs include fungi and single-celled protozoa. Fungi are the only organisms that can decompose wood. 
Dung  Beetle.  This dung beetle is rolling a 	  ball of feces to its nest to feed its young. 
D:  Banana  Slugs:  The  Ultimate  Recyclers 	  One of the most beloved and iconic native species within the old growth redwood forests of California is the Pacific Banana Slug. These slimy friends of the forest are the ultimate recyclers. Feeding on fallen leaves, mushrooms or even dead animals, they play a pivotal role in replenishing the soil. QUEST goes to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park near Santa Cruz, California on a hunt to find Ariolimax dolichophallus, a bright yellow slug with a very big personality. See URL for more information.

Summary 	  • Ecosystems require constant inputs of energy from sunlight or chemicals. • Producers use energy and inorganic molecules to make food. • Consumers take in food by eating producers or other living things. • Decomposers break down dead organisms and other organic wastes and release inorganic molecules back to the environment. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • The Theme of Ecosystem Energy Flow in Ecology: Organisms and Their Environments at URL hmoop.com/ecology/ecosystem-energy-flow.html . ate the plant? • Describe a typical food chain. • Explain how food chains and webs model feeding relationships. Who eats whom? Describing the flow of energy within an ecosystem essentially answers this question. To survive, one must eat. Why? To get energy. Food chains and webs describe the transfer of energy within an ecosystem, from one organism to another. In other words, they show who eats whom. 
Food  Chains and  Food  Webs 	  Food chains and food webs are diagrams that represent feeding relationships. Essentially, they show who eats whom. In this way, they model how energy and matter move through ecosystems. 
Food  Chains 	  A food chain represents a single pathway by which energy and matter flow through an ecosystem. An example is shown in Figure 6.6. Food chains are generally simpler than what really happens in nature. Most organisms consume—and are consumed by—more than one species. A musical summary of food chains can be heard at URL (2:46). 
Food  Webs 	  A food web represents multiple pathways through which energy and matter flow through an ecosystem. It includes many intersecting food chains. It demonstrates that most organisms eat, and are eaten, by more than one species. 
This food chain includes producers and 	  consumers. How could you add decomposers to the food chain? Examples are shown in Figures 6.7 and 6.8. 
Summary 	  • Food chains and food webs are diagrams that represent feeding relationships. • Food chains and webs model how energy and matter move through ecosystems. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Food Web at URL . 
Food  Web.  This food web consists of 	  several different food chains. Which organisms are producers in all of the food chains included in the food web? Examples of food webs. • Define trophic level. • Identify trophic levels in a food chain or web. • Describe an ecological pyramid. Why are pyramids important in ecology? The classic example of a pyramid is shown here. But the pyramid structure can also represent the decrease in a measured substance from the lowest level on up. In ecology, pyramids model the use of energy from the producers through the ecosystem. 
Trophic  Levels 	  The feeding positions in a food chain or web are called trophic levels. The different trophic levels are defined in the Table 6.1. Examples are also given in the table. All food chains and webs have at least two or three trophic levels. Generally, there are a maximum of four trophic levels. 
Trophic  Level 	  sumer sumer sumer Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. Humans, for example, are primary consumers when they eat plants such as vegetables. They are secondary consumers when they eat cows. They are tertiary consumers when they eat salmon. 
Trophic  Levels and  Energy 	  Energy is passed up a food chain or web from lower to higher trophic levels. However, generally only about 10 percent of the energy at one level is available to the next level. This is represented by the ecological pyramid in the environment as heat. This loss of energy explains why there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a food chain or web. Sometimes there may be a fifth trophic level, but usually there’s not enough energy left to support any additional levels. Ecological Pyramid. 
This pyramid 	  shows how energy and biomass decrease from lower to higher trophic levels. Assume that producers in this pyramid have much energy is available to primary consumers? Ecological pyramids can demonstrate the decrease in energy, biomass or numbers within an ecosystem. Energy pyramids are discussed at URL (1:44). 
Trophic  Levels and  Biomass 	  With less energy at higher trophic levels, there are usually fewer organisms as well. Organisms tend to be larger in size at higher trophic levels, but their smaller numbers result in less biomass. Biomass is the total mass of organisms at a trophic level. The decrease in biomass from lower to higher levels is also represented by Figure 6.9. 
Summary 	  • The different feeding positions in a food chain or web are called trophic levels. • Generally, there are no more than four trophic levels because energy and biomass decrease from lower to higher levels. • For a summary of Trophic Levels and Producer vs. Consumer, see URL Z12A8s .

Where does the water come from that is needed by your cells? Unlike energy, matter is not lost as it passes through an ecosystem. Instead, matter, including water, is recycled. This recycling involves specific interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors in an ecosystem. Chances are, the water you drank this morning has been around for millions of years, or more. 
The  Water  Cycle 	  The chemical elements and water that are needed by organisms continuously recycle in ecosystems. They pass through biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere. That’s why their cycles are called biogeochemical cycles. For example, a chemical might move from organisms (bio) to the atmosphere or ocean (geo) and back to organisms again. Elements or water may be held for various periods of time in different parts of a cycle. • Part of a cycle that holds an element or water for a short period of time is called an exchange pool. For example, the atmosphere is an exchange pool for water. It usually holds water (in the form of water vapor) for just a few days. • Part of a cycle that holds an element or water for a long period of time is called a reservoir. The ocean is a reservoir for water. The deep ocean may hold water for thousands of years. Water on Earth is billions of years old. However, individual water molecules keep moving through the water cycle. The water cycle is a global cycle. It takes place on, above, and below Earth’s surface, as shown in Figure 6.10. 
Like other biogeochemical cycles, there is 	  no beginning or end to the water cycle. It just keeps repeating. During the water cycle, water occurs in three different states: gas (water vapor), liquid (water), and solid (ice). Many processes are involved as water changes state in the water cycle. 
See  Watercourses at http://www.hippocampus.org/ Hippo Campus/ Earth%20 Science?load Left Class= Course&load Left 	  Id=153&loadTopicId=10689 . for a nice description of the flow of water. 
Evaporation,  Sublimation, and  Transpiration 	  Water changes to a gas by three different processes: water molecules enough energy to escape into the atmosphere. from the sun. 
Condensation and  Precipitation 	  Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation—rain, snow, sleet, hail, or 
Plant 	  They release water vapor into the air. leaves have many tiny stomata. freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or longer. 
Groundwater and  Runoff 	  Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface of the ground. This water is called runoff. It may eventually flow into a body of water. Some precipitation that falls on land may soak into the ground, becoming groundwater. Groundwater may seep out of the ground at a spring or into a body of water such as the ocean. Some groundwater may be taken up by plant roots. Some may flow deeper underground to an aquifer. This is an underground layer of rock that stores water, sometimes for thousands of years. The water cycle is demonstrated at URL (4:00). The "Water Cycle Jump" can be viewed at URL . (1:31).

Summary 	  • Chemical elements and water are recycled through biogeochemical cycles. The cycles include both biotic and abiotic parts of ecosystems. • The water cycle takes place on, above, and below Earth’s surface. In the cycle, water occurs as water vapor, liquid water, and ice.

How could releasing this much pollution into the atmosphere not be a poor idea? Burning of fossil fuels, such as oil, releases carbon into the atmosphere. This carbon must be cycled removed from the atmosphere back into living organisms, or it stays in the atmosphere. Increased carbon in the atmosphere contributes to the greenhouse effect on Earth. 
The  Carbon  Cycle 	  Flowing water can slowly dissolve carbon in sedimentary rock. Most of this carbon ends up in the ocean. The deep ocean can store carbon for thousands of years or more. Sedimentary rock and the ocean are major reservoirs of stored carbon. Carbon is also stored for varying lengths of time in the atmosphere, in living organisms, and as fossil fuel deposits. These are all parts of the carbon cycle, which is shown in Figure 6.12. The carbon cycle is discussed in the following video: URL (1:56). Why is recycling carbon important? Recall that carbon is the cornerstone of organic compounds, the compounds necessary for life. But do organisms make their own carbon? Do they have the genes that encode proteins necessary to make carbon? No. In fact, there are no such genes. Carbon must be recycled from other living organisms, from carbon in the atmosphere, and from carbon in other parts of the biosphere. 
Carbon in the  Atmosphere 	  Though carbon can be found in ocean water, rocks and sediment and other parts of the biosphere, the atmosphere may be the most recognizable reservoir of carbon. Carbon occurs in various forms in different parts of the carbon

Carbon in  Carbon  Dioxide 	  Carbon cycles quickly between organisms and the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, carbon exists primarily as carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide cycles through the atmosphere by several different processes, including those listed below. • Living organisms release carbon dioxide as a byproduct of cellular respiration. • Photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and uses it to make organic compounds. • Carbon dioxide is given off when dead organisms and other organic materials decompose. • Burning organic material, such as fossil fuels, releases carbon dioxide. • Carbon cycles far more slowly through geological processes such as sedimentation. Carbon may be stored in sedimentary rock for millions of years. • When volcanoes erupt, they give off carbon dioxide that is stored in the mantle. • Carbon dioxide is released when limestone is heated during the production of cement. • Ocean water releases dissolved carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when water temperature rises. • Carbon dioxide is also removed when ocean water cools and dissolves more carbon dioxide from the air. Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities • The Carbon Cycle at URL . • Outline the steps of the nitrogen cycle. • Explain nitrogen fixation. • Discuss the roles of ammonification, nitrification and denitrification in the nitrogen cycle. Alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupins, mesquite, carob, soy, and peanuts. What are these? Legumes. Legume plants have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, due to a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with bacteria found in root nodules of these plants. 
The  Nitrogen  Cycle 	  Nitrogen makes up 78 percent of Earth’s atmosphere. It’s also an important part of living things. Nitrogen is found in proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. The nitrogen cycle moves nitrogen through the abiotic and biotic parts of ecosystems. Figure 6.13 shows how nitrogen cycles through a terrestrial ecosystem. Nitrogen passes through a similar cycle in aquatic ecosystems. Even though nitrogen gas makes up most of Earth’s atmosphere, plants cannot use this nitrogen gas to make organic compounds for themselves and other organisms. The two nitrogen atoms in a molecule of nitrogen gas are held together by a very stable triple bond. This bond must be broken for the nitrogen to be used. The nitrogen gas must be changed to a form called nitrates, which plants can absorb through their roots. The process of changing nitrogen gas to nitrates is called nitrogen fixation. It is carried out by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The bacteria live in soil and roots of legumes, such as peas. When plants and other organisms die, decomposers break down their remains. In the process, they release nitrogen in the form of ammonium ions. This process is called ammonification. Nitrifying bacteria change the ammonium Nitrogen Cycle in a Terrestrial Ecosystem. 
Nitrogen cycles between the atmosphere 	  and living things. ions into nitrites and nitrates. Some of the nitrates are used by plants. The process of converting ammonium ions to nitrites or nitrates is called nitrification. Still other bacteria, called denitrifying bacteria, convert some of the nitrates in soil back into nitrogen gas in a process called denitrification. The process is the opposite of nitrogen fixation. Denitrification returns nitrogen gas back to the atmosphere, where it can continue the nitrogen cycle. See The Nitrogen Cycle: An Aquatic Perspective at URL (5:08) for a summary of this cycle. The cycle is also summarized at URL (2:04). 
Summary 	  • The nitrogen cycle moves nitrogen back and forth between the atmosphere and organisms. • Bacteria change nitrogen gas from the atmosphere to nitrogen compounds that plants can absorb. • Other bacteria change nitrogen compounds back to nitrogen gas, which re-enters the atmosphere.

What do temperature, wind and rain have in common? They are all part of climate, the statistical summary of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, other meteorological measurements in a given region over long periods. In other words, is it dry or wet, hot or cold, or humid? And it is these abiotic factors that help determine the nature of a biome. 
Terrestrial  Biomes 	  If you look at the two pictures in Figure 6.14, you will see very few similarities. The picture on the left shows a desert in Africa. The picture on the right shows a rainforest in Australia. The desert doesn’t have any visible plants, whereas the rainforest is densely packed with trees. What explains these differences? Terrestrial biomes include all the land areas on Earth where organisms live. The distinguishing features of terrestrial biomes are determined mainly by climate. Terrestrial biomes include tundras, temperate forests and grasslands, chaparral, temperate and tropical deserts, and tropical forests and grasslands. 
Terrestrial  Biomes and  Climate 	  Climate is the average weather in an area over a long period of time. Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere from day to day. Climate is generally described in terms of temperature and moisture. Sahara Desert in northern Africa (left). Rainforest in northeastern Australia (right). Two very different biomes are pictured here. A biome is a group of similar ecosystems with the same general abiotic factors and primary producers. Both are found at roughly the same distance from the equator. Temperature falls from the equator to the poles. Therefore, major temperature zones are based on latitude. They include tropical, temperate, and arctic zones (see Figure 6.15). However, other factors besides latitude may also influence temperature. For example, land near the ocean may have cooler summers and warmer winters than land farther inland. This is because water gains and loses heat more slowly than does land, and the water temperature influences the temperature on the coast. Temperature also falls from lower to higher altitudes. That’s why tropical zone mountain tops may be capped with snow. In terms of moisture, climates can be classified as arid (dry), semi-arid, humid (wet), or semi-humid. The amount of moisture depends on both precipitation and evaporation. Precipitation increases moisture. Evaporation decreases moisture. • The global pattern of precipitation is influenced by movements of air masses. For example, there is a global belt of dry air masses and low precipitation at about 30° N and 30° S latitude. • Precipitation is also influenced by temperature. Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air, so tropical areas receive more rainfall than other parts of the world. • Nearness to the ocean and mountain ranges may also influence the amount of precipitation an area receives. This is explained in Figure 6.16. • Evaporation of moisture is greatest where it is hot and sunny. Therefore, cold climates with low precipitation may not be as dry as warm climates with the same amount of precipitation. • Moist air from the ocean rises up over the mountain range. • As the air rises, it cools and its water vapor condenses. Precipitation falls on the windward side of the mountain range. • The air is dry when it reaches the leeward side of the mountain range, so there is little precipitation there. This creates a “rain shadow.” Temperature zones are based on latitude. What temperature zone do you live in? 
This diagram shows how precipitation is 	  affected by the ocean and a mountain range. 
Climate and  Plant  Growth 	  Plants are the major producers in terrestrial biomes. They have five basic needs: air, warmth, sunlight, water, and nutrients. How well these needs are met in a given location depends on the growing season and soil quality, both of which are determined mainly by climate. • The growing season is the period of time each year when it is warm and wet enough for plants to grow. The growing season may last all year in a hot, wet climate but just a few months in a cooler or drier climate. • Plants grow best in soil that contains plenty of nutrients and organic matter. Both are added to soil when plant litter and dead organisms decompose. Decomposition occurs too slowly in cold climates and too quickly in hot, wet climates for nutrients and organic matter to accumulate. Temperate climates usually have the best soil for plant growth. 
Climate and  Biodiversity 	  Because climate determines plant growth, it also influences the number and variety of other organisms in a terrestrial biome. Biodiversity generally increases from the poles to the equator. It is also usually greater in more humid climates. This is apparent from the desert and rainforest biomes pictured in Figure 6.14. 
Climate and  Adaptations 	  Organisms evolve adaptations that help them survive in the climate of the biome where they live. For example, in biomes with arid climates, plants may have special tissues for storing water (see Figure 6.17). The desert animals pictured in Figure 6.18 also have adaptations for a dry climate. The aloe plant on the left stores water in its large, hollow leaves. The cactus plant on the right stores water in its stout, barrel-shaped stems. In biomes with cold climates, plants may adapt by becoming dormant during the coldest part of the year. Dormancy is a state in which a plant slows down cellular activities and may shed its leaves. Animals also adapt to cold temperatures. One way is with insulation in the form of fur and fat. This is how the polar bears in Figure 6.19 stay warm. The Gila monster’s fat tail is an adaptation to its dry climate. It serves as a storage depot for water. The kangaroo rat has very efficient kidneys. They produce concentrated urine, thus reducing the amount of water lost from the body. Thick fur and a layer of blubber keep polar bears warm in their Arctic ecosystem. 
Why do you think their fur is white?  Why 	  might it be an adaptation in an Arctic biome?

Survey of  Terrestrial  Biomes 	  Terrestrial biomes are classified by the climate and their biodiversity, especially the types of primary producers. The world map in Figure 6.20 shows where 13 major terrestrial biomes are found. The following figures summarize the basic features of major terrestrial biomes. As you read about each biome, think about how its biodiversity and types of plants and animals relate to its climate. For example, why do you think there are no amphibians or reptiles in tundra biomes? (Hint: Amphibians and reptiles cannot maintain a constant body temperature. Instead, they have about the same temperature as their surroundings.)

Do aquatic ecosystems need sunlight? Of course. The sunlight in part allows the diversity of life seen in this ecosystem. If the available sunlight was less, could this ecosystem still thrive? Maybe, but the ecosystem would probably be very different. Sunlight, of course, is necessary for photosynthesis, which brings energy into an ecosystem. So, the availability of that sunlight has a direct impact on the productivity and biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems. 
Aquatic  Biomes 	  Terrestrial organisms are generally limited by temperature and moisture. Therefore, terrestrial biomes are defined in terms of these abiotic factors. Most aquatic organisms do not have to deal with extremes of temperature or moisture. Instead, their main limiting factors are the availability of sunlight and the concentration of dissolved oxygen and nutrients in the water. These factors vary from place to place in a body of water and are used to define aquatic biomes. 
Aquatic  Biomes and  Sunlight 	  In large bodies of standing water, including the ocean and lakes, the water can be divided into zones based on the amount of sunlight it receives: where enough sunlight penetrates for photosynthesis to occur. Algae and other photosynthetic organisms can make food and support food webs. synthesis to occur. As a result, food must be made by chemosynthesis or else drift down from the water above. These and other aquatic zones in the ocean are identified in Figure 6.21. 
The ocean is divided into many different 	  zones, depending on distance from shore and depth of water. 
Aquatic  Biomes and  Dissolved  Substances 	  Water in lakes and the ocean also varies in the amount of dissolved oxygen and nutrients it contains: is because surface water absorbs oxygen from the air above it. nutrients enter the water from land. They are carried by runoff, streams, and rivers that empty into a body of water. When aquatic organisms die, they sink to the bottom. Decomposers near the bottom of the water break down the dead organisms and release their nutrients back into the water. 
Marine  Biomes 	  Anglerfish live in the ocean. Aquatic biomes in the ocean are called marine biomes. Organisms that live in marine biomes must be adapted to the salt in the water. For example, many have organs for excreting excess salt. Two ocean zones are particularly challenging to marine organisms: the intertidal zone and the deep ocean. The intertidal zone is the narrow strip along the coastline that is covered by water at high tide and exposed to air at low tide (see Figure 6.22). There are plenty of nutrients and sunlight in the intertidal zone. However, the water is constantly moving in and out, and the temperature keeps changing. These conditions require adaptations in the organisms that live there, such as the barnacles in Figure 6.23. 
These pictures show the intertidal zone of 	  the Bay of Fundy, on the Atlantic coast in Maine. Can you identify the intertidal zone from the pictures? Barnacles secrete a cement-like substance that anchors them to rocks in the intertidal zone. Organisms that live deep in the ocean must be able to withstand extreme water pressure, very cold water, and complete darkness. However, even here, thriving communities of living things can be found. Organisms cluster around hydrothermal vents in the ocean floor. The vents release hot water containing chemicals that would be toxic to most other living things. The producers among them are single-celled chemoautotrophs. They make food using energy stored in the chemicals. 
Monitoring  Marine  Protected  Areas 	  Is overfishing an important issue? What would happen if fish populations dwindled? Marine Protected Areas are no-fishing zones that have recently been established up and down the California coast, in the hope of allowing fish to breed, grow large, and replenish state waters. Scientists monitor these areas to determine if this process is working. See URL for additional information. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

What may be the most biologically diverse type of ecosystem? These are wetland marshes in Delaware. Notice the abundance of vegetation mixed with the water. And of course, where there are plants, there are animals. Wetlands are considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems. Plant life found in wetlands includes mangrove, water lilies, cattails, black spruce, cypress, and many others. Animal life includes many different amphibians, reptiles, birds, insects, and mammals. 
Freshwater  Biomes 	  Freshwater biomes have water that contains little or no salt. They include standing and running freshwater biomes. Standing freshwater biomes include ponds and lakes. Lakes are generally bigger and deeper than ponds. Some of the water in lakes is in the aphotic zone, where there is too little sunlight for photosynthesis. Plankton and plants, such as the duckweed in Figure 6.24, are the primary producers in standing freshwater biomes. Running freshwater biomes include streams and rivers. Rivers are usually larger than streams. Streams may start with runoff or water seeping out of a spring. The water runs downhill and joins other running water to become a stream. A stream may flow into a river that empties into a lake or the ocean. Running water is better able to dissolve oxygen and nutrients than standing water. However, the moving water is a challenge to many living things. Algae and plants, such as the cattails in Figure 6.24, are the primary producers in running water biomes. 
Wetlands 	  A wetland is an area that is saturated with water or covered by water for at least one season of the year. The water may be freshwater or salt water. Wetlands are extremely important biomes for several reasons: The pond on the left has a thick mat of duckweed plants. They cover the surface of the water and use sunlight for photosynthesis. The cattails on the right grow along a stream bed. They have tough, slender leaves that can withstand moving water. • They store excess water from floods. • They slow down runoff and help prevent erosion. • They remove excess nutrients from runoff before it empties into rivers or lakes. • They provide a unique habitat that certain communities of plants need to survive. • They provide a safe, lush habitat for many species of animals, so they have high biodiversity.

For more than 100 years, south San Francisco Bay has been a center for industrial salt production. Now federal and state biologists are working to restore the ponds to healthy wetlands for fish and other wildlife. Salt marshes are rich habitats that provide shelter and food for many species, some of which are endangered or threatened.

D:  San  Francisco  Bay:  A  Unique  Estuary 	  An estuary is a partly enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the ocean. Estuaries can be thought of as the most biologically productive regions on Earth, with very high biodiversity. Estuaries are zones where land and sea come together, and where fresh and salt water meet. The San Francisco Bay is one of the great estuaries of the world. See URL n0 for further information.

These worms use their plumes to catch plankton and other small particles passing in the water. Cilia then pass the food to the worm’s mouth.

D:  Studying  Aquatic  Animals 	  Oceans cover more than 70 percent of our planet, yet they are some of the least explored regions on Earth. Who better to unlock the mysteries of the ocean than marine animals themselves? Marine scientists have been tagging and tracking sharks, leatherback turtles, and other sea life to learn more about marine ecosystems. Through the Tagging of Pacific Predators program (TOPP), scientists hope to assess and explain the migration routes, ecosystems, and diversity of our oceans’ species. Beginning in 2000, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Stanford University, and the University of California, Santa Cruz combined to form TOPP. As part of TOPP, researchers attach satellite tags to elephant seals, white sharks, giant leatherback turtles, bluefin tuna, swordfish, and other marine animals. The tags collect information, such as how deep each animal dives, the levels of ambient light (to help determine an animal’s location), and interior and exterior body temperature. Some tags also collect information about the temperature, salinity, and depth of the water surrounding an animal to help scientists identify ocean currents. The tags send the data to a satellite, which in turn sends the data the scientists. They use this information to create maps of migration patterns and discover new information about different marine ecosystems. The information collected by TOPP offers rare insights into the lives of marine animals. Without TOPP, that information would otherwise remain unknown. With TOPP, scientists are developing a working knowledge of the particular migration routes animals take, as well as the locations of popular breeding grounds and the environmental dangers faced by different species. TOPP has shed light on how we can better protect the leatherback turtle and other endangered species. See URL more information. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • Aquatic organisms are either plankton, nekton, or benthos. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • URL Science → Environmental Science Multimedia→ Search: NOAA: Deepsea Benthos • Describe predation and its effects on population size and evolution. • Define a keystone species. • Describe the use of camouflage as an adaptation. What may be the most common way different species interact? Biomes as different as deserts and wetlands share something very important. All biomes have populations of interacting species. Species interact in the same basic ways in all biomes. For example, all biomes have some species that prey on others for food. 
Predation 	  Predation is a relationship in which members of one species (the predator) consume members of another species (the prey). The lionesses and zebra in Figure 6.26 are classic examples of predators and prey. In addition to the lionesses, there is another predator in this figure. Can you spot it? The other predator is the zebra. Like the lionesses, it consumes prey species, in this case species of grass. However, unlike the lionesses, the zebra does not kill its prey. Predator-prey relationships such as these account for most energy transfers in food chains and food webs. 
Predation and  Population 	  A predator-prey relationship tends to keep the populations of both species in balance. This is shown by the graph in population increases as well. As the number of predators increases, more prey are captured. As a result, the prey population starts to decrease. What happens to the predator population then? Predators and Their Prey. onesses feed on the carcass of a zebra. These liPredator-Prey Population Dynamics. As the prey population increases, why does the predator population also increase? In the predator-prey example, one factor limits the growth of the other factor. As the prey population deceases, the predator population is begins to decrease as well. The prey population is a limiting factor. A limiting factor limits the growth or development of an organism, population, or process. 
Keystone  Species 	  Some predator species are known as keystone species. A keystone species is one that plays an especially important role in its community. Major changes in the numbers of a keystone species affect the populations of many other species in the community. For example, some sea star species are keystone species in coral reef communities. The sea stars prey on mussels and sea urchins, which have no other natural predators. If sea stars were removed from a coral reef community, mussel and sea urchin populations would have explosive growth. This, in turn, would drive out most other species. In the end, the coral reef community would be destroyed. 
Adaptations to  Predation 	  Both predators and prey have adaptations to predation that evolve through natural selection. Predator adaptations help them capture prey. Prey adaptations help them avoid predators. A common adaptation in both predator and prey is camouflage. Several examples are shown in Figure 6.28. Camouflage in prey helps them hide from predators. Camouflage in predators helps them sneak up on prey. Camouflage in Predator and Prey Species. Can you see the crab in the photo on the left? It is camouflaged with the sand. The preying mantis in the middle photo looks just like the dead leaves in the background. Can you tell where one zebra ends and another one begins? This may confuse a predator and give the zebras a chance to run away.

Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Predation at URL . • Distinguish between intraspecific and interspecific competition. • Explain why interspecific competition leads to extinction or greater specialization. Does there have to be a winner? When animals compete? Yes. Animals, or other organisms, will compete when both want the same thing. One must "lose" so the winner can have the resource. But competition doesn’t necessarily involve physical altercations. 
Competition 	  Competition is a relationship between organisms that strive for the same resources in the same place. The resources might be food, water, or space. There are two different types of competition: same species might compete for mates in the same area. This type of competition is a basic factor in natural selection. It leads to the evolution of better adaptations within a species. species might compete for the same prey. 
Interspecific  Competition and  Extinction 	  Interspecific competition often leads to extinction. The species that is less well adapted may get fewer of the resources that both species need. As a result, members of that species are less likely to survive, and the species may go extinct. 
Interspecific  Competition and  Specialization 	  Instead of extinction, interspecific competition may lead to greater specialization. Specialization occurs when competing species evolve different adaptations. For example, they may evolve adaptations that allow them to use different food sources. Figure 6.29 describes an example. 
Specialization lets different species of 	  anole lizards live in the same area without competing. 
Summary 	  • Competition is a relationship between organisms that strive for the same resources in the same place. • Intraspecific competition occurs between members of the same species. It improves the species’ adaptations. • Interspecific competition occurs between members of different species. 
It may lead to one species going 	  extinct or both becoming more specialized.

Do interactions between species always result in harm? A commensal shrimp sits on another sea organism, a sea slug. As a commensal shrimp, it neither brings a benefit nor has a negative effect on its host. 
Symbiotic  Relationships 	  Symbiosis is a close relationship between two species in which at least one species benefits. For the other species, the relationship may be positive, negative, or neutral. There are three basic types of symbiosis: mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. 
Mutualism 	  Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit. An example of mutualism involves goby fish and shrimp (see Figure 6.30). The nearly blind shrimp and the fish spend most of their time together. The shrimp maintains a burrow in the sand in which both the fish and shrimp live. When a predator comes near, the fish touches the shrimp with its tail as a warning. Then, both fish and shrimp retreat to the burrow until the predator is gone. From their relationship, the shrimp gets a warning of approaching danger. The fish gets a safe retreat and a place to lay its eggs. 
The multicolored shrimp in the front and 	  the green goby fish behind it have a mutualistic relationship. 
Commensalism 	  Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other species is not affected. One species typically uses the other for a purpose other than food. For example, mites attach themselves to larger flying insects to get a “free ride.” Hermit crabs use the shells of dead snails for homes. 
Parasitism 	  Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species (the parasite) benefits while the other species (the host) is harmed. Many species of animals are parasites, at least during some stage of their life. Most species are also hosts to one or more parasites. Some parasites live on the surface of their host. Others live inside their host. They may enter the host through a break in the skin or in food or water. For example, roundworms are parasites of mammals, including humans, cats, and dogs (see Figure 6.31). The worms produce huge numbers of eggs, which are passed in the host’s feces to the environment. Other individuals may be infected by swallowing the eggs in contaminated food or water. Some parasites kill their host, but most do not. It’s easy to see why. If a parasite kills its host, the parasite is also likely to die. Instead, parasites usually cause relatively minor damage to their host. 
Summary 	  • Symbiosis is a close relationship between two species in which at least one species benefits. • Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit. • Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other species is not affected. • Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species (the parasite) benefits while the other species (the host) is harmed.

Can a plant really grow in hardened lava? It can if it is very hardy and tenacious. And that is how succession starts. It begins with a plant that must be able to grow on new land with minimal soil or nutrients. 
Ecological  Succession 	  Communities are not usually static. The numbers and types of species that live in them generally change over time. This is called ecological succession. Important cases of succession are primary and secondary succession. 
Primary  Succession 	  Primary succession occurs in an area that has never before been colonized. Generally, the area is nothing but bare rock. This type of environment may come about when • lava flows from a volcano and hardens into rock. • a glacier retreats and leaves behind bare rock. • a landslide uncovers an area of bare rock. The first species to colonize a disturbed area such as this are called pioneer species (see Figure 6.32). They change the environment and pave the way for other species to come into the area. Pioneer species are likely to include bacteria and lichens that can live on bare rock. Along with wind and water, they help weather the rock and form soil. Once soil begins to form, plants can move in. At first, the plants include grasses and other species that can grow in thin, poor soil. As more plants grow and die, organic matter is added to the soil. This improves the soil and helps it hold water. The improved soil allows shrubs and trees to move into the area. Primary Succession. New land from a volcanic eruption is slowly being colonized by a pioneer species. 
Secondary  Succession 	  Secondary succession occurs in a formerly inhabited area that was disturbed. The disturbance could be a fire, flood, or human action such as farming. This type of succession is faster because the soil is already in place. In this case, the pioneer species are plants such as grasses, birch trees, and fireweed. Organic matter from the pioneer species improves the soil. This lets other plants move into the area. An example of this type of succession is shown in Secondary Succession. Two months after a forest fire, new plants are already sprouting among the charred logs. 
Climax  Communities 	  Many early ecologists thought that a community always goes through the same series of stages during succession. They also assumed that succession always ends with a final stable stage. They called this stage the climax community. Today, most ecologists no longer hold these views. They believe that continued change is normal in most ecosystems. They think that most communities are disturbed too often to become climax communities.

Is this any way to live? It is if you’re a penguin. This population of penguins is made of all the individuals of the same species of penguins who live together. They seem to exist in a very crowded or densely populated environment, and in a random configuration. 
Population  Size,  Density, and  Distribution 	  Communities are made up of populations of different species. In biology, a population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area. The population is the unit of natural selection and evolution. How large a population is and how fast it is growing are often used as measures of its health. Population size is the number of individuals in a population. For example, a population of insects might consist of Generally, very small populations are at greatest risk of extinction. However, the size of a population may be less important than its density. 
Population  Density 	  Population density is the average number of individuals in a population per unit of area or volume. For example, a population of 100 insects that live in an area of 100 square meters has a density of 1 insect per square meter. If the same population lives in an area of only 1 square meter, what is its density? Which population is more crowded? How might crowding affect the health of a population? 
Population  Distribution 	  Population density just represents the average number of individuals per unit of area or volume. Often, individuals in a population are not spread out evenly. Instead, they may live in clumps or some other pattern (see Figure 6.34). The pattern may reflect characteristics of the species or its environment. Population distribution describes how the individuals are distributed, or spread throughout their habitat. 
Patterns of  Population  Distribution.  What 	  factors influence the pattern of a population over space?

When it comes to populations, yes it does. The age structure (and the sex structure) of a population influences population growth. Can you explain why? 
Population  Structure 	  Population growth is the change in the size of the population over time. An important factor in population growth is age-sex structure. This is the number of individuals of each sex and age in the population. The age-sex structure influences population growth. This is because younger people are more likely to reproduce, while older people have higher rates of dying. 
Population  Pyramids 	  Age-sex structure is represented by a population pyramid. This is a bar graph, like the one Figure 6.35. In this example, the bars become narrower from younger to older ages. Can you explain why? 
Survivorship  Curves 	  Another way to show how deaths affect populations is with survivorship curves. These are graphs that represent the number of individuals still alive at each age. Examples are shown in Figure 6.36. A population pyramid represents the agesex structure of a population. What does a large base represent? 
Survivorship curves reflect death rates at 	  different ages. The three types of curves shown in the figure actually represent different strategies species use to adapt to their environment: • Type I: Parents produce relatively few offspring and provide them with a lot of care. As a result, most of the offspring survive to adulthood so they can reproduce. This pattern is typical of large animals, including humans. • Type II: Parents produce moderate numbers of offspring and provide some parental care. Deaths occur more uniformly throughout life. This pattern occurs in some birds and many asexual species. • Type III: Parents produce many offspring but provide them with little or no care. As a result, relatively few offspring survive to adulthood. This pattern is typical of plants, invertebrates, and many species of fish. See URL for an overview of survivorship curves. The Type I strategy occurs more often in stable environments. The Type III strategy is more likely in unstable environments. Can you explain why?

What would old luggage have to do with population growth? Moving into an area, or immigration, is a key factor in the growth of populations. Shown above is actual vintage luggage left by some of the millions of immigrants who came through Ellis Island and into the United States. 
Population  Growth 	  Populations gain individuals through births and immigration. They lose individuals through deaths and emigration. These factors together determine how fast a population grows. 
Population  Growth  Rate 	  Population growth rate (r) is how fast a population changes in size over time. A positive growth rate means a population is increasing. A negative growth rate means it is decreasing. The two main factors affecting population growth are the birth rate (b) and death rate (d). Population growth may also be affected by people coming into the population from somewhere else ( immigration, i) or leaving the population for another area ( emigration, e). The formula for population growth takes all these factors into account. r = (b + i) (d + e) • r = population growth rate • b = birth rate • i = immigration rate • d = death rate • e = emigration rate Two lectures on demography are available at URL (50:36) and URL ww.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg3ESbyKbic (49:38). 
Dispersal 	  Other types of movements may also affect population size and growth. For example, many species have some means of dispersal. This refers to offspring moving away from their parents. This prevents the offspring from competing with the parents for resources such as light or water. For example, dandelion seeds have “parachutes.” They allow the wind to carry the seeds far from the parents (see Figure 6.37). Dandelion Seeds. 
These dandelion 	  seeds may disperse far from the parent plant. Why might this be beneficial to both parents and offspring? 
Migration 	  Migration is another type of movement that changes population size. Migration is the regular movement of individuals or populations each year during certain seasons. The purpose of migration usually is to find food, mates, or other resources. For example, many northern hemisphere birds migrate thousands of miles south each fall. They go to areas where the weather is warmer and more resources are available (see Figure 6.38). Then they return north in the spring to nest. Some animals, such as elk, migrate vertically. They go up the sides of mountains in spring as snow melts. They go back down the mountain sides in fall as snow returns.

This map shows where individual hawks 	  have been identified during their migration.

What starts out very small and has the potential to grow considerably larger? Trees, of course. But also populations. Give a population everything it needs to survive, and the growth of that population will be tremendous. 
Patterns of  Population  Growth 	  Populations may show different patterns of growth. The growth pattern depends partly on the conditions under which a population lives. 
Exponential  Growth 	  Under ideal conditions, populations of most species can grow at exponential rates. Curve A in Figure 6.39 represents exponential growth. The population starts out growing slowly. As population size increases, the growth rate also increases. The larger the population becomes, the faster it grows. 
Logistic  Growth 	  Most populations do not live under ideal conditions. Therefore, most do not grow exponentially. Certainly, no population can keep growing exponentially for very long. Many factors may limit growth. Often, the factors are density dependent (known as density-dependent factors). These are factors that are influential when the population 
A shows exponential growth.  Curve  	  shows logistic growth. becomes too large and crowded. For example, the population may start to run out of food or be poisoned by its own wastes. As a result, population growth slows and population size levels off. Curve B in Figure 6.39 represents this pattern of growth, which is called logistic growth. At what population size does growth start to slow in the logistic model of growth? That depends on the population’s carrying capacity (see Figure 6.39). The carrying capacity (K) is the largest population size that can be supported in an area without harming the environment. Population growth hits a ceiling at that size in the logistic growth model. Species can be divided into two basic types when it comes to how their populations grow. • Species that live in stable environments are likely to be K -selected. Their population growth is controlled by density-dependent factors. Population size is generally at or near the carrying capacity. These species are represented by curve B in Figure 6.39. • Species that live in unstable environments are likely to be r -selected. Their potential population growth is rapid. For example, they have large numbers of offspring. However, individuals are likely to die young. Thus, population size is usually well below the carrying capacity. These species are represented by the lower part of curve A in Figure 6.39. (r is the population growth rate. See the "Population Growth" concept.) 
Summary 	  • Under ideal conditions, populations can grow exponentially. • The growth rate increases as the population gets larger. • Most populations do not live under ideal conditions and grow logistically instead. • Density-dependent factors slow population growth as population size nears the carrying capacity.

How do humans adapt to their environment? It could be said that the human population does not have to adapt to its environment, but forces the environment to change to suit us. We can live practically anywhere we want, eat all types of food, and build all types of housing. Because of all of these "adaptations," our population has grown, after a slow start, considerably fast. 
The  Human  Population 	  Humans have been called the most successful "weed species" Earth has ever seen. Like weeds, human populations are fast growing. They also disperse rapidly. They have colonized habitats from pole to pole. Overall, the human population has had a pattern of exponential growth, as shown in Figure 6.40. The population increased very slowly at first. As it increased in size, so did its rate of growth. 
Early  Population  Growth 	  Homo sapiens arose about 200,000 years ago in Africa. Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. They first left Africa about 40,000 years ago. They soon moved throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, they had reached the Americas. During this long period, birth and death rates were both fairly high. As a result, population growth was slow. Humans invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also let them settle down in villages and cities for the first time. The death rate increased because of diseases associated with domestic animals and crowded living conditions. The birth rate increased because there was more food and settled life offered other advantages. The combined effect was continued slow population growth. 
Growth of the  Human  Population.  This 	  graph gives an overview of human population growth since 10,000 BC. It took until about 1800 AD for the number of humans to reach 1 billion. 
It took only 	  a little over 100 years for the number to reach 2 billion. The human population recently passed the 7 billion mark! Why do you think the human population began growing so fast? 
Summary 	  • Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. Both birth and death rates were fairly high. As a result, human population growth was very slow. • The invention of agriculture increased both birth and death rates. The population continued to grow slowly. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Human Numbers Through Time at URL . growth? • Define demographic transition. • Outline the stages of the demographic transition. Do populations continuously grow? Not necessarily. The growth of a population depends on a number of issues. Obviously, the average age of the individuals of that population is important. But other factors, such as the local economy, also play a role. 
Demographic  Transition 	  Major changes in the human population first began during the 1700s in Europe and North America. First death rates fell, followed somewhat later by birth rates. 
Death  Rates  Fall 	  Several advances in science and technology led to lower death rates in 18th century Europe and North America: • New scientific knowledge of the causes of disease led to improved water supplies, sewers, and personal hygiene. • Better farming techniques and machines increased the food supply. • The Industrial Revolution of the 1800s led to new sources of energy, such as coal and electricity. This increased the efficiency of the new agricultural machines. It also led to train transport, which improved the distribution of food. For all these reasons, death rates fell, especially in children. This allowed many more children to survive to adulthood, so birth rates increased. As the gap between birth and death rates widened, the human population grew faster. 
Birth  Rates  Fall 	  It wasn’t long before birth rates started to fall as well in Europe and North America. People started having fewer children because large families were no longer beneficial for several reasons. • As child death rates fell and machines did more work, farming families no longer needed to have as many children to work in the fields. • Laws were passed that required children to go to school. Therefore, they could no longer work and contribute to their own support. They became a drain on the family’s income. Eventually, birth rates fell to match death rates. As a result, population growth slowed to nearly zero. 
Stages of the  Demographic  Transition 	  These changes in population that occurred in Europe and North America have been called the demographic transition. The transition can be summarized in the following four stages, which are illustrated in Figure 6.41: • Stage 1—High birth and death rates lead to slow population growth. • Stage 2—The death rate falls but the birth rate remains high, leading to faster population growth. • Stage 3—The birth rate starts to fall, so population growth starts to slow. • Stage 4—The birth rate reaches the same low level as the death rate, so population growth slows to zero. 
Stages of the  Demographic  Transition.  In 	  the demographic transition, the death rate falls first. After a lag, the birth rate also falls. How do these changes affect the rate of population growth over time? 
Summary 	  • Major changes in the human population first began during the 1700s. This occurred in Europe and North America. • First, death rates fell while birth rates remained high. This led to rapid population growth. • Later, birth rates also fell. As a result, population growth slowed. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Demographic Transition Model at URL . • Explain trends in recent human population growth. • Summarize expectations of future human population growth. • Discuss issues associated with a large human population. Should the population of the planet by characterized by individual country, or as one general population? How many people is too many? Is there a limit? Is there a carrying capacity for humans? These are important questions that do not have an easy answer. But as our population continues to grow, these questions and others should be discussed. 
Recent  Population  Growth 	  At one time, scientists predicted that all human populations would pass through the same demographic transition as Europe and North America. Now, they are not so sure. Death rates have fallen throughout the world. No country today remains in Stage 1 of the transition. However, birth rates are still high in many poor countries. These populations seem to be stuck in Stage 2. An example is the African country of Angola. Its population pyramid for Many other countries have shifted to Stage 3 of the transition. Birth rates have started to fall. As a result, population growth is slowing. An example is Mexico. Its population pyramid for 1998 is shown in Figure 6.43. It reflects a recent fall in the birth rate. 
Angola’s population pyramid is typical of 	  Stage 2 of the demographic transition. Mexico’s 1998 population pyramid is typical of Stage 3 population. How can you tell that the birth rate has started to fall? Most developed nations have entered Stage 4. Sweden is an example (see Figure 6.44). The birth rate has been low for many years in Sweden. Therefore, the rate of population growth is near zero. 
Sweden’s 1998 population pyramid shows 	  a population in Stage 4. In some countries, birth rates have fallen even lower than death rates. As result, their population growth rates are negative. In other words, the populations are shrinking in size. These populations have top-heavy population pyramids, like the one for Italy shown in Figure 6.45. This is a new stage of the demographic transition, referred to as Stage 5. You might think that a negative growth rate would be a good thing. In fact, it may cause problems. For example, growth-dependent industries decline. Supporting the large aging population is also a burden for the shrinking younger population of workers. This 1998 population pyramid for Italy represents a Stage 5 population. 
Future  Population  Growth 	  During the month of October 2011, the world’s population surpassed 7 billion people. It took just 12 years for the population to increase by a billion people. At this rate, there may be well over 9 billion people by 2050, and easily URL . The human population is now growing by more than 200,000 people a day. The human population may well be close to its carrying capacity. It has already harmed the environment. An even larger human population may cause severe environmental problems. This could lead to outbreaks of disease, starvation, and global conflict. There are three potential solutions: Which solution would you choose?

Census  Update:  What the  World  Will  Look like in 2050 	  On June 30, 2011, Time.com published Census Update: What the World Will Look Like in 2050 at URL com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2080404,00.html . According to the U.S Census Bureau, in 2050, there will be 9.4 billion people: • India will be the most populous nation, surpassing China sometime around 2025. • The U.S. will remain the third most populous nation, with a population of 423 million (up from 308 million in 2010). • Declining birth rates in Japan and Russia will cause them to fall from their current positions as the 9th and • Nigeria will have a population of 402 million, up from 166 million people. • Ethiopia’s population will likely triple, from 91 million to 278 million, making the East African nation one of the top 10 most populous countries in the world. So what does all this mean? • The African continent is expected to experience significant population growth in the coming decades, which could compound existing food supply problems in some African nations. • Immigration and differing birth rates among races will change the ethnic composition of the U.S. • Population booms in Africa and India, the decline of Russia, and the expected plateau of China will all change the makeup of the estimated 9.4 billion people who will call Earth home in 2050. 
Summary 	  • Other countries have completed similar demographic transitions. However, some countries seem stalled at early stages. They have high birth rates and rapidly growing populations. • The total human population may have to stop growing eventually. Even if we reduce our use of resources and distribute them more fairly, at some point the carrying capacity will be reached.

What is biodiversity? How many species exist? We don’t really know for sure. But all those species together, from the smallest bacteria, the deadliest protist, the most bizarre fungi, the prettiest plant, and the biggest mammal, compile the diversity of life, or biodiversity. What Is Biodiversity? Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes, including the variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among them, and the communities and ecosystems in which they occur. Scientists have identified about still discovering new species. Thus, they do not know for sure how many species really exist today. Most estimates range from 5 to 30 million species. 
Cogs and  Wheels 	  “The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the pieces.” –attributed to Aldo Leopold, but probably a shortened version of: “To save every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.” Aldo Leopold,

Known species represent only a fraction 	  of all species that exist on Earth. have likely found the term an appropriate description of his “cogs and wheels.” Literally, biodiversity is the many different kinds (diversity) of life (bio-). Biologists, however, always alert to levels of organization, have identified three measures of life’s variation. Species diversity best fits the literal translation: the number of different species in a particular ecosystem or on Earth. A second measure recognizes variation within a species: differences among individuals or populations make up genetic diversity. Finally, as Leopold clearly understood, the “cogs and wheels” include not only life but also the land, sea, and air that support life. Ecosystem diversity describes the many types of functional units formed by living communities interacting with their environments. Although all three levels of diversity are important, the term biodiversity usually refers to species diversity. A discussion of biodiversity is available at URL (6:12).

Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Biodiversity at URL • Identify economic benefits of biodiversity. • Discuss ecosystem services of biodiversity. Why is biodiversity important? Think about how many species exist. Most likely well over 5 million. Now think about how much information about those species we do not yet understand. We do not know what we can learn from them. Why Is Biodiversity Important? Human beings benefit in many ways from biodiversity. Biodiversity has direct economic benefits. It also provides services to entire ecosystems. 
Economic  Benefits of  Biodiversity 	  The diversity of species provides humans with a wide range of economic benefits: • Wild plants and animals maintain a valuable pool of genetic variation. This is important because domestic species are genetically uniform. This puts them at great risk of dying out due to disease. • Other organisms provide humans with many different products. Timber, fibers, adhesives, dyes, and rubber are just a few. • Certain species may warn us of toxins in the environment. When the peregrine falcon nearly went extinct, for example, it warned us of the dangers of DDT. • More than half of the most important prescription drugs come from wild species. Only a fraction of species have yet been studied for their medical potential. • Other living things provide inspiration for engineering and technology. For example, the car design in Figure From flowers to fish, biodiversity benefits humans in many ways. 
Ecosystem  Services of  Biodiversity 	  Biodiversity generally increases the productivity and stability of ecosystems. species will survive environmental change. It also provides many other ecosystem services. For example: 
It helps ensure that at least some 	  • Plants and algae maintain the atmosphere. During photosynthesis, they add oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. • Plants help prevent soil erosion. They also improve soil quality when they decompose. • Microorganisms purify water in rivers and lakes. They also return nutrients to the soil. • Bacteria fix nitrogen and make it available to plants. Other bacteria recycle the nitrogen from organic wastes and remains of dead organisms. • Insects and birds pollinate flowering plants, including crop plants. • Natural predators control insect pests. They reduce the need for expensive pesticides, which may harm people and other living things.

Killing a Philippine Eagle is punishable under Philippine law by twelve years in jail and heavy fines. 
Human  Actions and the  Sixth  Mass  Extinction 	  Over 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth have gone extinct. Five mass extinctions are recorded in the fossil record. They were caused by major geologic and climatic events. Evidence shows that a sixth mass extinction is occurring now. Unlike previous mass extinctions, the sixth extinction is due to human actions. Some scientists consider the sixth extinction to have begun with early hominids during the Pleistocene. They are blamed for over-killing big mammals such as mammoths. Since then, human actions have had an ever greater impact on other species. The present rate of extinction is between 100 and 100,000 species per year. In 100 years, we could lose more than half of Earth’s remaining species. 
Causes of  Extinction 	  The single biggest cause of extinction today is habitat loss. Agriculture, forestry, mining, and urbanization have disturbed or destroyed more than half of Earth’s land area. In the U.S., for example, more than 99 percent of tall-grass prairies have been lost. Other causes of extinction today include: • Exotic species introduced by humans into new habitats. They may carry disease, prey on native species, and disrupt food webs. Often, they can out-compete native species because they lack local predators. An example is described in Figure 6.49. • Over-harvesting of fish, trees, and other organisms. This threatens their survival and the survival of species that depend on them. • Global climate change, largely due to the burning of fossil fuels. This is raising Earth’s air and ocean temperatures. It is also raising sea levels. These changes threaten many species. • Pollution, which adds chemicals, heat, and noise to the environment beyond its capacity to absorb them. This causes widespread harm to organisms. • Human overpopulation, which is crowding out other species. It also makes all the other causes of extinction worse. The brown tree snake is an exotic species that has caused many extinctions on Pacific islands such as Guam. 
Effects of  Extinction 	  The results of a study released in the summer of 2011 have shown that the decline in the numbers of large predators like sharks, lions and wolves is disrupting Earth’s ecosystem in all kinds of unusual ways. The study, conducted by scientists from 22 different institutions in six countries, confirmed the sixth mass extinction. The study states that this mass extinction differs from previous ones because it is entirely driven by human activity through changes in land use, climate, pollution, hunting, fishing and poaching. The effects of the loss of these large predators can be seen in the oceans and on land. • Fewer cougars in the western US state of Utah led to an explosion of the deer population. The deer ate more vegetation, which altered the path of local streams and lowered overall biodiversity. • In Africa, where lions and leopards are being lost to poachers, there is a surge in the number of olive baboons, who are transferring intestinal parasites to humans living nearby. • In the oceans, industrial whaling led a change in the diets of killer whales, who eat more sea lions, seals, and otters and have dramatically lowered the population counts of those species. The study concludes that the loss of big predators has likely driven many of the pandemics, population collapses and ecosystem shifts the Earth has seen in recent centuries.

How  You  Can  Help  Protect  Biodiversity 	  There are many steps you can take to help protect biodiversity. For example: • Consume wisely. Reduce your consumption wherever possible. Re-use or recycle rather than throw out and buy new. When you do buy new, choose products that are energy efficient and durable. • Avoid plastics. Plastics are made from petroleum and produce toxic waste. • Go organic. Organically grown food is better for your health. It also protects the environment from pesticides and excessive nutrients in fertilizers. • Save energy. Unplug electronic equipment and turn off lights when not in use. Take mass transit instead of driving. See URL for an outstanding 60 Minutes video of the Great Migration in Kenya, and the issues facing these animals. 
Lost  Salmon 	  Why is the salmon population of Northern California so important? Salmon do not only provide food for humans, but also supply necessary nutrients for their ecosystems. Because of a sharp decline in their numbers, in part due to human interference, the entire salmon fishing season off California and Oregon was canceled in both 2008 and 2009. The species in the most danger of extinction is the California coho salmon.

Renewable or nonrenewable, what’s the difference? That’s like asking the difference between having an endless supply and having a limited supply. Will this planet eventually run out of oil? Probably. So oil is a nonrenewable resource. 
Renewable and  Nonrenewable  Resources 	  A natural resource is something supplied by nature that helps support life. When you think of natural resources, you may think of minerals and fossil fuels. However, ecosystems and the services they provide are also natural resources. Biodiversity is a natural resource as well. 
Renewable  Resources 	  Renewable resources can be replenished by natural processes as quickly as humans use them. Examples include sunlight and wind. They are in no danger of being used up (see Figure 6.50). Metals and other minerals are renewable too. They are not destroyed when they are used and can be recycled. Living things are considered to be renewable. This is because they can reproduce to replace themselves. However, they can be over-used or misused to the point of extinction. To be truly renewable, they must be used sustainably. Sustainable use is the use of resources in a way that meets the needs of the present and also preserves the resources for future generations. 
Wind is a renewable resource.  Wind 	  turbines like this one harness just a tiny fraction of wind energy. 
Nonrenewable  Resources 	  Nonrenewable resources are natural resources that exist in fixed amounts and can be used up. Examples include fossil fuels such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas. These fuels formed from the remains of plants over hundreds of millions of years. We are using them up far faster than they could ever be replaced. At current rates of use, petroleum will be used up in just a few decades and coal in less than 300 years. Nuclear power is also considered to be a nonrenewable resource because it uses up uranium, which will sooner or later run out. It also produces harmful wastes that are difficult to dispose of safely. 
Turning  Trash  Into  Treasure 	  Scientists at the Massachusetts of Technology are turning trash into coal, which can readily be used to heat homes and cook food in developing countries. This coal burns cleaner than that from fossil fuels. It also save a tremendous amount of energy. See URL for more information. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • Renewable resources can be replaced by natural processes as quickly as humans use them. Examples include sunlight and wind. • Nonrenewable resources exist in fixed amounts. They can be used up. Examples include fossil fuels such as coal. 
Gasoline is made from crude oil.  The 	  crude oil pumped out of the ground is a black liquid called petroleum, which is a nonrenewable resource. Coal is another nonrenewable resource.

Could this land be used for agriculture? Probably not. The quality of soil is very important in determining what can grow in a particular area. Good soil is not so easy to come by. Soil should be considered another resource that we, as a population, must strive to protect. 
Soil and  Water  Resources 	  Theoretically, soil and water are renewable resources. However, they may be ruined by careless human actions. 
Soil 	  Soil is a mixture of eroded rock, minerals, partly decomposed organic matter, and other materials. It is essential for plant growth, so it is the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems. Soil is important for other reasons as well. For example, it removes toxins from water and breaks down wastes. Although renewable, soil takes a very long time to form—up to hundreds of millions of years. So, for human purposes, soil is a nonrenewable resource. It is also constantly depleted of nutrients through careless use, and eroded by wind and water. For example, misuse of soil caused a huge amount of it to simply blow away in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl (see Figure 6.53). Soil must be used wisely to preserve it for the future. Conservation practices include contour plowing and terracing. Both reduce soil erosion. Soil also must be protected from toxic wastes. The Dust Bowl occurred between 1933 and 1939 in Oklahoma and other southwestern U.S. states. Plowing had exposed prairie soil. Drought turned the soil to dust. Intense dust storms blew away vast quantities of the soil. Much of the soil blew all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. 
Water 	  Water is essential for all life on Earth. For human use, water must be fresh. Of all the water on Earth, only 1 percent is fresh, liquid water. Most of the rest is either salt water in the ocean or ice in glaciers and ice caps. Although water is constantly recycled through the water cycle, it is in danger. Over-use and pollution of freshwater threaten the limited supply that people depend on. Already, more than 1 billion people worldwide do not have adequate freshwater. With the rapidly growing human population, the water shortage is likely to get worse. KQED: Are We in Danger of Running Out of Water? California’s population is growing by 600,000 people a year, but much of the state receives as much annual rainfall as Morocco. With fish populations crashing, global warming, and the demands of the country’s largest agricultural industry, the pressures on our water supply are increasing. Is the U.S.’s largest population in danger of running out of water? See URL for additional information. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Too  Much of a  Good  Thing 	  Water pollution comes from many sources. One of the biggest sources is runoff. Runoff picks up chemicals such as fertilizer from agricultural fields, lawns, and golf courses. It carries the chemicals to bodies of water. The added nutrients from fertilizer often cause excessive growth of algae, creating algal blooms (see Figure 6.54). The algae use up oxygen in the water so that other aquatic organisms cannot survive. This has occurred over large areas of the ocean, creating dead zones, where low oxygen levels have killed all ocean life. A very large dead zone exists in the Gulf of Mexico. Measures that can help prevent these problems include cutting down on fertilizer use. Preserving wetlands also helps because wetlands filter runoff water. Algal Bloom. Nutrients from fertilizer in runoff caused this algal bloom. 
Summary 	  • Soil and water are renewable resources but may be ruined by careless human actions. Soil can be depleted of nutrients. It can also be eroded by wind or water. • Over-use and pollution of freshwater threaten the limited supply that people depend on.

Why is the atmosphere important? Well, it contains all of the air that we breathe. The atmosphere also has other roles and functions, so when we interfere with the atmosphere, we interfere with some important biological processes. And this can have consequences. 
The  Atmosphere 	  The atmosphere plays an important part in maintaining Earth’s freshwater supply. It is part of the water cycle. It refills lakes and rivers with precipitation. The atmosphere also provides organisms with gases needed for life. It contains oxygen for cellular respiration and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. 
Air  Pollution 	  Earth’s atmosphere is vast. However, it has been seriously polluted by human activities. Air pollution consists of chemical substances and particles released into the atmosphere, mainly by human actions. The major cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels. Power plants, motor vehicles, and home furnaces all burn fossil fuels and contribute to the problem (see Table 6.4). Ranching and using chemicals such as fertilizers also cause air pollution. Erosion of soil in farm fields and construction sites adds dust particles to the air as well. Fumes from building materials, furniture, carpets, and paint add toxic chemicals to indoor air. Air pollution comes from many sources, including waste expelled into the atmosphere by numerous factories. 
Pollutant 	  Sulfur oxides (SOx) Nitrogen oxides (NOx) Carbon monoxide (CO) Carbon dioxide (CO2) Particulate matter (smoke, dust) 
Coal-fired power plants, medical 	  waste 
Global  Warming 	  Respiratory disease, Global Dimming 
Respiratory problems; eye irritation 	  In humans, air pollution causes respiratory and cardiovascular problems. In fact, more people die each year from air pollution than automobile accidents. Air pollution also affects ecosystems worldwide by causing acid rain, ozone depletion, and global warming. Ways to reduce air pollution from fossil fuels include switching to nonpolluting energy sources (such as solar energy) and using less energy. What are some ways you could use less energy? 
Acid  Rain 	  All life relies on a relatively narrow range of pH, or acidity. That’s because protein structure and function are very sensitive to pH. Air pollution can cause precipitation to become acidic. Nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mainly from motor vehicle exhaust and coal burning, create acids when they combine with water in the air. The acids lower the pH of precipitation, forming acid rain. If acid rain falls on the ground, it may damage soil and soil organisms. If it falls on plants, it may kill them (see Figure 6.56). If it falls into lakes, it lowers the pH of the water and kills aquatic organisms. 
Ozone  Depletion 	  There are two types of ozone. You can think of them as bad ozone and good ozone. Both are affected by air pollution. • Bad ozone forms near the ground when sunlight reacts with pollutants in the air. Ground-level ozone is harmful to the respiratory systems of humans and other animals. • Good ozone forms in a thin layer high up in the atmosphere, between 15 and 35 kilometers above Earth’s surface. This ozone layer shields Earth from most of the sun’s harmful UV radiation. It plays an important role in preventing mutations in the DNA of organisms. Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. 
Summary 	  • Air pollution consists of chemical substances and particles released into the air, mainly by human actions. • The major cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels. • Indoor air can also be polluted. • Air pollution causes acid rain, ozone depletion, and global warming. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Air Pollution at URL . • Greenhouse Light and Temperature at URL . • Explain the greenhouse effect. • Define global warming. • Explain the effects of global climate change. Is the Earth really fragile? Maybe not the planet, but how about the ecosystems? It may soon be hard to argue that global climate change does not exist. Climate change can definitely be seen in numerous ecosystems. So what will we do about it? 
Global  Climate  Change 	  Another major problem caused by air pollution is global climate change. Gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels increase the natural greenhouse effect. This raises the temperature of Earth’s surface. See the NASA site Global Climate Change Vital Signs of the Planet at URL for a thorough overview of this topic. What Is the Greenhouse Effect? The greenhouse effect is a natural feature of Earth’s atmosphere. It occurs when gases in the atmosphere radiate the sun’s heat back down to Earth’s surface (see Figure 6.57). Otherwise, the heat would escape into space. Without the greenhouse effect, Earth’s surface temperature would be far cooler than it is. In fact, it would be too cold to support life as we know it. The Greenhouse Effect. Without greenhouse gases, most of the sun’s energy would be radiated from Earth’s surface back out to space. 
Global  Warming 	  Global warming refers to a recent increase in Earth’s average surface temperature (see Figure 6.58). During the past century, the temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). That may not seem like much. But consider that just 10°C is the difference between an ice-free and an ice-covered Earth. 
The average annual temperature on  Earth 	  has been rising for the past 100 years. Most scientists agree that global warming is caused by more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (see Figure 6.59). This increases the greenhouse effect. There is more carbon dioxide mainly because of the burning of fossil fuels. Destroying forests is another cause. With fewer forests, less carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. This graph shows the recent trend in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
Effects of  Climate  Change 	  How has global warming affected Earth and its life? Some of its effects include: • Decline in cold-adapted species such as polar bears. • Melting of glaciers and rising sea levels. • Coastal flooding and shoreline erosion. • Heat-related human health problems. • More droughts and water shortages. • Changing patterns of precipitation. • Increasing severity of storms. • Major crop losses. These two videos discuss some of the consequences from changes in ecosystems: URL ?v=jHWgWxDWhsA (7:47) and URL (2:26). 
D:  Climate  Watch:  California at the  Tipping  Point 	  The world’s climate is changing and California is now being affected in both dramatic and subtle ways. In 2008, scientists determined that California’s temperatures increased by more than 2.1°F during the last century. What’s more, the data showed that human activity has played a significant role in that climate change. "What’s just 2 degrees?" you may wonder. But, as the science shows, just 2 degrees is extremely significant. What does all this temperature change mean? For starters, declining mountain snowpack and prolonged drought conditions could pose a threat to limited water supplies. Heat waves are projected to be longer, bringing increased danger from wildfires and heat-related deaths. Rising sea levels due to temperature shifts jeopardize life in coastal areas, both for human communities and the plants and animals that rely on intertidal and rich wetland ecosystems. Also, more precipitation is expected to fall as rain rather than snow, thereby increasing the risk of floods. And, as heat increases the formation of smog, poor air quality could get even worse. Climate change may also profoundly affect the economy in California and elsewhere. Shorter ski seasons and damage to the marine ecosystem mean a reduction in tourism. Water shortages mean issues with the commercial and recreational fishing industry, and higher temperatures will affect crop growth and quality, weakening the agricultural industry, to name just a few of the economic issues associated with climate change.

D:  Giant  Redwoods and  Global  Warming 	  Forest ecologist Steve Sillett is leading a team of scientists as they climb and measure every branch of some of the last and tallest old growth redwoods in California. Their goal is to learn how these ancient giants have historically responded to climatic shifts and to monitor how they are being impacted today by global warming.

D:  Acidic  Seas 	  Melting glaciers, rising temperatures and droughts are all impacts of global warming. But how does global warming actually affect the oceans? The sea, it turns out, absorbs carbon dioxide emissions. The ocean acts like a giant sponge, absorbing carbon dioxide emissions from the air. And as we add more and more carbon dioxide to air by burning fossil fuels, the ocean is absorbing it. On one level, it’s done us a big favor. Scientists say that we would be experiencing much more extreme climate change were it not for the ocean’s ability to remove the heat-trapping gas. However, these emissions are causing the oceans to become more acidic. Changing pH levels threaten entire marine food webs, from coral reefs to salmon. See URL for additional information. Click image to the left or use the URL below. As carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, the levels also increase in the oceans. What effects does this have?

Click image to the left or use the URL below. What Can Be Done? Efforts to reduce future global warming mainly involve energy use. We need to use less energy, for example, by driving more fuel-efficient cars. We also need to switch to energy sources that produce less carbon dioxide, such as solar and wind energy. At the same time, we can increase the amount of carbon dioxide that is removed from air. We can stop destroying forests and plant new ones.

Summary 	  Ecology discusses ecosystems. An ecosystem consists of all the populations and the non-living aspects of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the abiotic factors of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent surges in the human population have raised many important issues. lor/Stony Brook University/NOAA; Seaweed: User:Flyingdream/Wikipedia; Cyanobacteria: Barry H.

Introduction 	  What’s the smallest living organism? Is it a virus? Or a bacterium? Are viruses living? We could not exist without bacteria. Could we exist without viruses? These, and other questions will be addressed through the Prokaryotes and Viruses chapter. • Define prokaryote. • Compare Bacteria to Archaea, and to Eukarya. What are the most numerous organisms on the planet? Bacteria. And all it takes is one to quickly grow, under just the right conditions, into millions and billions. Luckily, we know how to control bacteria when necessary. But bacteria do serve many important purposes. In fact, we could not survive without them. 
Evolution of  Prokaryotes 	  No doubt you’ve had a sore throat before, and you’ve probably eaten cheese or yogurt. If so, then you’ve encountered the fascinating world of prokaryotes. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus. They also lack other membrane-bound organelles. Prokaryotes are tiny and sometimes bothersome, but they are the most numerous organisms on Earth. Without them, the world would be a very different place. Prokaryotes are the simplest organisms. The first cells and organisms to evolve would be classified as prokaryotic. An overview of bacteria can be seen at URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Prokaryotes are currently placed in two domains. A domain is the highest taxon, just above the kingdom. The prokaryote domains are Bacteria and Archaea (see Figure 7.1). The third domain is Eukarya. It includes all eukaryotes. Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a nucleus in their cells. living 
The  Three  Domains of  Life.  All 	  things are grouped in three domains. The domains Bacteria and Archaea consist of prokaryotes. The Eukarya domain consists of eukaryotes. It’s not clear how the three domains are related. Archaea were once thought to be offshoots of Bacteria that were adapted to extreme environments. For their part, Bacteria were considered to be ancestors of Eukarya. Scientists now know that Archaea share several traits with Eukarya that Bacteria do not share (see Table 7.1). How can this be explained? One hypothesis is that Eukarya arose when an Archaean cell fused with a Bacterial cell. The two cells became the nucleus and cytoplasm of a new Eukaryan cell.

Summary 	  • Prokaryotes include Bacteria and Archaea. An individual prokaryote consists of a single cell without a nucleus. • Bacteria live in virtually all environments on Earth. • Archaea live everywhere on Earth, including extreme environments. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • How did life originate? at URL . • Outline the classification of prokaryotes. • Distinguish Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. • Compare extreme halophiles to hyperthermophiles to acidophiles. With so many different bacteria, how are they all classified? By shape? By size? By some other criteria? As you can imagine, classifying bacteria is probably not an easy task. Bacteria are classified by their traits, some of which have to do with their shape, others with the cell wall, and even additional traits. 
Domain  Bacteria 	  Bacteria are the most diverse and abundant group of organisms on Earth. They live in almost all environments. They are found in the ocean, the soil, and the intestines of animals. They are even found in rocks deep below Earth’s surface. Any surface that has not been sterilized is likely to be covered with bacteria. The total number of bacteria in the world is amazing. It’s estimated to be 5 × 1030, or five million trillion. You have more bacteria in and on your body than you have body cells! Bacteria called cyanobacteria are very important. They are bluish green in color (see Figure 7.2) because they contain chlorophyll (but not chloroplasts, of course). They make food through photosynthesis and release oxygen into the air. These bacteria were probably responsible for adding oxygen to the air on early Earth. This changed the 
Cyanobacteria  Bloom.  The green streaks 	  in this lake consist of trillions of cyanobacteria. Excessive nutrients in the water led to overgrowth of the bacteria. planet’s atmosphere. It also changed the direction of evolution. Ancient cyanobacteria also may have evolved into the chloroplasts of plant cells. Thousands of species of bacteria have been discovered, and many more are thought to exist. The known species can be classified on the basis of various traits. One classification is based on differences in their cell walls and outer membranes. It groups bacteria into Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as described in Figure 7.3. 
Classification of  Bacteria.  Different types 	  of bacteria stain a different color when stained with Gram stain. This makes them easy to identify. 
Domain  Archaea 	  Scientists still know relatively little about Archaea. This is partly because they are hard to grow in the lab. Many live inside the bodies of animals, including humans. However, none are known for certain to cause disease. Archaea were first discovered in extreme environments. For example, some were found in hot springs. Others were found around deep sea vents. Such Archaea are called extremophiles, or “lovers of extremes.” Figure 7.4 describes three different types of Archaean extremophiles. The places where some of them live are thought to be similar to the environment on ancient Earth. This suggests that they may have evolved very early in Earth’s history. 
Extremophile  Archaea.  Many  Archaea 	  are specialized to live in extreme environments. 
Just three types are described 	  here. Archaea are now known to live just about everywhere on Earth. They are particularly numerous in the ocean. Archaea in plankton may be one of the most abundant types of organisms on the planet. Archaea are also thought to play important roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycles. For these reasons, Archaea are now recognized as a major aspect of life on Earth. 
Summary 	  • Bacteria live in virtually all environments on Earth. • Archaea live everywhere on Earth, including extreme environments. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Bacteria at URL . • Summarize the main structures of the prokaryotic cell. • Describe the structure and function of the bacterial cell wall. Does the shape matter? It does if you’re a bacterium. Prokaryotic cells are distinguished by their shape. And as you can imagine, shape may have something to do with mobility. 
Prokaryote  Structure 	  Most prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells. Although they are tiny, prokaryotic cells can be distinguished by their shapes. The most common shapes are helices, spheres, and rods (see Figure 7.5). 
Plasma  Membrane and  Cell  Wall 	  Like other cells, prokaryotic cells have a plasma membrane (see Figure 7.6). It controls what enters and leaves the cell. It is also the site of many metabolic reactions. For example, cellular respiration and photosynthesis take place in the plasma membrane. Prokaryotic Cell Shapes. The three most common prokaryotic cell shapes are shown here. Most prokaryotes also have a cell wall. It lies just outside the plasma membrane. It gives strength and rigidity to the cell. Bacteria and Archaea differ in the makeup of their cell wall. The cell wall of Bacteria contains peptidoglycan, composed of sugars and amino acids. The cell wall of most Archaea lacks peptidoglycan. 
Prokaryotic  Cell.  The main parts of a 	  prokaryotic cell are shown in this diagram. 
The structure called a mesosome was 	  once thought to be an organelle. More evidence has convinced most scientists that it is not a true cell structure at all. 
Instead, it seems to be an artifact of cell 	  preparation. This is a good example of how scientific knowledge is revised as more evidence becomes available. Can you identify each of the labeled structures? 
Cytoplasm and  Cell  Structures 	  Inside the plasma membrane of prokaryotic cells is the cytoplasm. It contains several structures, including ribosomes, a cytoskeleton, and genetic material. Ribosomes are sites where proteins are made. The cytoskeleton helps the cell keep its shape. The genetic material is usually a single loop of DNA. There may also be small, circular pieces of DNA, called plasmids. (see Figure 7.7). The cytoplasm may contain microcompartments as well. These are tiny structures enclosed by proteins. They contain enzymes and are involved in metabolic processes. Prokaryotic DNA. The DNA of a prokaryotic cell is in the cytoplasm because the cell lacks a nucleus. 
Extracellular  Structures 	  Many prokaryotes have an extra layer, called a capsule, outside the cell wall. The capsule protects the cell from chemicals and from drying out. It also allows the cell to stick to surfaces and to other cells. Because of this, many prokaryotes can form biofilms, like the one shown in Figure 7.8. A biofilm is a colony of prokaryotes that is stuck to a surface such as a rock or a host’s tissues. The sticky plaque that collects on your teeth between brushings is a biofilm. It consists of millions of bacteria. Most prokaryotes also have long, thin protein structures called flagella (singular, flagellum). They extend from the plasma membrane. Flagella help prokaryotes move. They spin around a fixed base, causing the cell to roll and tumble. As shown in Figure 7.9, prokaryotes may have one or more flagella. 
Endospores 	  Many organisms form spores for reproduction. Some prokaryotes form spores for survival. Called endospores, they form inside prokaryotic cells when they are under stress. The stress could be UV radiation, high temperatures, or harsh chemicals. Endospores enclose the DNA and help it survive under conditions that may kill the cell. Endospores are commonly found in soil and water. They may survive for long periods of time. 
Bacterial  Biofilm.  The greatly magnified 	  biofilm shown here was found on a medical catheter (tubing) removed from a patient’s body. Variations in the Flagella of Bacteria. 
Flagella in prokaryotes may be located at 	  one or both ends of the cell or all around it. 
They help prokaryotes move toward food 	  or away from toxins. 
Summary 	  • Most prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells. • Prokaryotic cells have a cell wall outside their plasma membrane. • Prokaryotic DNA consists of a single loop. Some prokaryotes also have small, circular pieces of DNA called plasmids. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Structure and Function of Bacterial Cells at URL . • Identify different types of metabolism found in prokaryotes. • Compare photoautotrophs to chemoheterotrophs. What do bacteria need to grow? Like most everything else, they need food. Given the right conditions, bacteria can grow from just a few cells to millions or billions overnight. 
Prokaryote  Metabolism 	  Like all living things, prokaryotes need energy and carbon. They meet these needs in a variety of ways. In fact, prokaryotes have just about every possible type of metabolism. They may get energy from light (photo) or chemical compounds (chemo). They may get carbon from carbon dioxide ( autotroph) or other living things ( heterotroph). Most prokaryotes are chemoheterotrophs. They depend on other organisms for both energy and carbon. Many break down organic wastes and the remains of dead organisms. They play vital roles as decomposers and help recycle carbon and nitrogen. Photoautotrophs are important producers. They are especially important in aquatic ecosystems. 
Classification of  Prokaryotes  Based on  Metabolism 	  Two major nutritional needs can be used to group prokaryotes. These are (1) carbon metabolism, their source of carbon for building organic molecules within the cells, and (2) energy metabolism, their source of energy used for growth. In terms of carbon metabolism, prokaryotes are classified as either heterotrophic or autotrophic: • Heterotrophic organisms use organic compounds, usually from other organisms, as carbon sources. • Autotrophic organisms use carbon dioxide (CO2) as their only source or their main source of carbon. Many autotrophic bacteria are photosynthetic, and get their carbon from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Energy metabolism in prokaryotes is classified as one of the following: • Phototrophic organisms capture light energy from the sun and convert it into chemical energy inside their cells. • Chemotrophic organisms break down either organic or inorganic molecules to supply energy for the cell. Some chemotrophic organisms can also use their organic energy-supplying molecules as a carbon supply, which would make them chemoheterotrophs. • Photoheterotrophs are organisms that capture light energy to convert to chemical energy in the cells, but they get carbon from organic sources (other organisms). Examples are purple non-sulfur bacteria, green non-sulfur bacteria and heliobacteria. • Chemoheterotrophs are organisms that get their energy source and carbon source from organic sources. Chemoheterotrophs must consume organic building blocks that they are unable to make themselves. Most get their energy from organic molecules such as sugars. This nutritional mode is very common among eukaryotes, including humans. • Photoautotrophs are cells that capture light energy, and use carbon dioxide as their carbon source. There are many photoautotrophic prokaryotes, which include cyanobacteria. Photoautotrophic prokaryotes use similar compounds to those of plants to trap light energy. • Chemoautotrophs are cells that break down inorganic molecules to supply energy for the cell, and use carbon dioxide as a carbon source. Chemoautotrophs include prokaryotes that break down hydrogen sulfide (H2S the “rotten egg” smelling gas), and ammonia (NH4). Nitrosomonas, a species of soil bacterium, oxidizes NH4 + −). This reaction releases energy that the bacteria use. Many chemoautotrophs also live in to nitrite (NO2 extreme environments such as deep sea vents. 
This flowchart helps to determine if a 	  species is an autotroph or a heterotroph, a phototroph or a chemotroph. For example, “Obtain carbon elsewhere?” asks if the source of carbon is another organism. the organism is If the answer is “yes”, heterotrophic. 
If the answer is “no,” the 	  organisms is autotrophic. 
Summary 	  • Prokaryotes fulfill their carbon and energy needs in various ways. They may be photoautotrophs, chemoautotrophs, photoheterotrophs, or chemoheterotrophs.

Where do you find lots of bacteria? Practically all surfaces. Bacteria can live and grow in practically any environment. It is this ability that has made bacteria the most numerous species on the planet. 
Prokaryote  Habitats 	  Prokaryotes have a wide range of metabolisms, and this determines where they live. They live in a particular habitat because they are able to “eat” whatever is around them. For example, there are bacteria and archaea that break down hydrogen sulfide to produce ATP. Hydrogen sulfide is the gas that gives rotten eggs and sewage their distinctive smell. It is poisonous to animals, but some prokaryotes depend on it for life. Organisms that are obligate aerobes need oxygen to live. That is, they use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor while making ATP (see the “Cellular Respiration” concept). Humans are obligate aerobes, and so are Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. M. tuberculosis causes tuberculosis (TB). Obligate aerobes are found only in places with molecular oxygen. An anaerobic organism is any organism that does not need oxygen for growth and even dies in its presence. Obligate anaerobes will die when exposed to atmospheric levels of oxygen. Clostridium perfringens bacteria, which are commonly found in soil around the world, are obligate anaerobes. Infection of a wound by C. perfringens bacteria causes the disease gas gangrene. Obligate anaerobes use molecules other than oxygen as terminal electron acceptors. Facultative anaerobic organisms, which are usually prokaryotic, make ATP by aerobic respiration, if oxygen is present, but can also survive without oxygen. In the absence of oxygen they switch to the process of fermentation to make ATP. Fermentation is a type of heterotrophic metabolism that uses organic carbon instead of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. Examples of facultative anaerobic bacteria are the Staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium, and Listeria species. Many bacteria that cause human diseases are facultative anaerobic organisms. 
Temperature 	  Like most organisms, prokaryotes live and grow best within certain temperature ranges. Prokaryotes can be classified by their temperature preferences, as shown in the Table 7.2. Which type of prokaryote would you expect to find inside the human body? Thermophiles live at relatively high temperatures, above 45°C (113°F). Thermophiles are found in geothermally heated regions of the Earth, such as hot springs like the Morning Glory pool in Yellowstone National Park (see and compost. Many thermophiles are archaea. Extreme thermophiles (or hyperthermophiles), live in temperatures hotter than 80°C (176°F). Psychrophiles grow and reproduce in cold temperatures. The optimal growth temperature of some psychrophiles is 15°C or lower; they cannot grow in temperatures above 20°C. The environments that psychrophiles inhabit are found all over Earth. Psychrophiles live in such places as permafrost soils, deep-ocean waters, Arctic and Antarctic glaciers and snowfields. Mesophiles grow best in moderate temperature, typically between 25°C and 40°C (77°F and 104°F). Mesophiles are often found living in or on the bodies of humans or other animals. The optimal growth temperature of many pathogenic mesophiles is 37°C (98°F), the normal human body temperature. Mesophilic organisms have important uses in food preparation, including cheese, yogurt, beer and wine.

How do bacteria reproduce? Essentially, they grow and divide. Show here is an example of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, bacteria. Notice how one bacterium is dividing into two. 
Reproduction in  Prokaryotes 	  Unlike multicellular organisms, increases in the size of prokaryotes (cell growth) and their reproduction by cell division are tightly linked. Prokaryotes grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission. For a discussion of exponential growth and bacteria see URL (10:43). 
Binary  Fission 	  It occurs when a parent cell splits into two identical daughter Binary fission is a type of asexual reproduction. cells. This can result in very rapid population growth. For example, under ideal conditions, bacterial populations can double every 20 minutes. Such rapid population growth is an adaptation to an unstable environment. Can you explain why? 
Schematic diagram of cellular growth (elongation) and binary fission of 	  bacilli. Blue and red lines indicate old and newly-synthesized bacterial cell wall, respectively. The DNA inside the bacterium is copied and the daughter cells receive an exact copy of the parent DNA. Fission involves a cytoskeletal protein FtsZ that forms a ring at the site of cell division. 
Genetic  Transfer 	  In asexual reproduction, all the offspring are exactly the same. This is the biggest drawback of this type of reproduction. Why? Lack of genetic variation increases the risk of extinction. Without variety, there may be no organisms that can survive a major change in the environment. Prokaryotes have a different way to increase genetic variation. It’s called genetic transfer or bacterial conjugation. It can occur in two ways. One way is when cells “grab” stray pieces of DNA from their environment. The other way is when cells directly exchange DNA (usually plasmids) with other cells. For example, as shown in Figure 7.13, the donor cell makes a structure called an F pilus, or sex pilus. The F pilus attaches one cell to another cell. The membranes of the two cells merge and genetic material, usually a plasmid, moves into the recipient cell. Genetic transfer makes bacteria very useful in biotechnology. It can be used to create bacterial cells that carry new genes.

Can you guess what organisms are pictured here? Are they fat green worms on a red leaf? Here’s a clue: There are more organisms like these than any other on Earth. Here’s another clue: Each organism consists of a single cell without a nucleus. The organisms are bacteria called Salmonella. If the word Salmonella rings a bell, that’s probably because Salmonella causes human diseases such as food poisoning. Many other types of bacteria also cause human diseases. But not all bacteria are harmful to people. In fact, we could not survive without many of the trillions of bacteria that live in or on the human body. 
Bacteria and  Humans 	  Bacteria and humans have many important relationships. Bacteria make our lives easier in a number of ways. In fact, we could not survive without them. On the other hand, bacteria can also make us sick. 
Benefits of  Bacteria 	  Bacteria provide vital ecosystem services. They are important decomposers. They are also needed for the carbon and nitrogen cycles. There are billions of bacteria inside the human intestines. They help digest food, make vitamins, and play other important roles. Humans also use bacteria in many other ways, including: • Creating products, such as ethanol and enzymes. • Making drugs, such as antibiotics and vaccines. • Making biogas, such as methane. • Cleaning up oil spills and toxic wastes. • Killing plant pests. • Transferring normal genes to human cells in gene therapy. • Fermenting foods (see Figure 7.14). Fermented Foods. Fermentation is a type of respiration that doesn’t use oxygen. Fermentation by bacteria is used in brewing and baking. It is also used to make the foods pictured here. 
Bacteria and  Disease 	  You have ten times as many bacteria as human cells in your body. Most of these bacteria are harmless. However, bacteria can also cause disease. Examples of bacterial diseases include tetanus, syphilis, and food poisoning. Bacteria may spread directly from one person to another. For example, they can spread through touching, coughing, or sneezing. They may also spread via food, water, or objects. Another way bacteria and other pathogens can spread is by vectors. A vector is an organism that spreads pathogens from host to host. Insects are the most common vectors of human diseases. Figure 7.15 shows two examples. Humans have literally walked into some new bacterial diseases. When people come into contact with wild populations, they may become part of natural cycles of disease transmission. Consider Lyme disease. It’s caused by bacteria that normally infect small, wild mammals, such as mice. A tick bites a mouse and picks up the bacteria. The tick may then bite a human who invades the natural habitat. Through the bite, the bacteria are transmitted to the human host. 
Controlling  Bacteria 	  Bacteria in food or water usually can be killed by heating it to a high temperature (generally, at least 74◦C, or 165◦F). Bacteria on many surfaces can be killed with chlorine bleach or other disinfectants. Bacterial infections in people Bacterial Disease Vectors. Ticks spread bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Deerflies spread bacteria that cause tularemia. can be treated with antibiotic drugs. For example, if you ever had “strep” throat, you were probably treated with an antibiotic. Antibiotics have saved many lives. However, misuse and over-use of the drugs have led to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Figure 7.16 shows how antibiotic resistance evolves. Some strains of bacteria are now resistant to most common antibiotics. These infections are very difficult to treat. 
Summary 	  • Bacteria and humans have many important relationships. Bacteria provide humans with a number of services. They also cause human diseases. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Bacteria: Friend or Foe? at URL . Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria. This diagram shows how antibiotic resistance evolves by natural selection. • Define virus and virion. • Describe a virus. This virus looks alive, but is it? Notice the big virus. He (or she) looks very angry. But actually viruses cannot be a "he" or a "she" or big either. In fact, viruses are the smallest things. Much smaller than most prokaryotes. We also cannot say that viruses are the smallest living things or organisms, as viruses do not meet the definition of living or of an organism. 
Characteristics of  Viruses 	  Which of the three domains of life do viruses belong to? None. Why? Viruses are usually considered to be nonliving. Viruses do not meet most of the criteria of life. They are not even made of cells. An overview of viruses can be seen at URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. A virus is a sub-microscopic particle that can infect living cells. Viruses are much smaller than prokaryotes, ranging in size from about 20–300 nanometers (nm), though some can be larger. Prokaryotes are typically 0.5–5.0 micrometres (µm) in length. For example, if a virus was about the size of three soccer balls lying side-by-side, then a prokaryote would be about the size of soccer field. An individual virus is called a virion. It is a tiny particle much smaller than a prokaryotic cell. Because viruses do not consist of cells, they also lack cell membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and other cell organelles. Without these structures, they are unable to make proteins or even reproduce on their own. Instead, they must depend on a host cell to synthesize their proteins and to make copies of themselves. Although viruses are not classified as living things, they share two important traits with living things. They have genetic material, and they can evolve. This is why the classification of viruses has been controversial. It calls into question just what it means to be alive. What do you think? How would you classify viruses? The study of viruses is known as virology and people who study viruses are known as virologists. Viruses infect and live inside the cells of living organisms. When viruses infect the cells of their host, they may cause disease. For example, viruses cause AIDS (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome), influenza (flu), chicken pox, and the common cold. Therapy is sometimes difficult for viral diseases. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses and only a few antiviral drugs are available for some diseases. One of the best ways to prevent viral diseases is with a vaccine, which produces immunity. But vaccines are available for only a few diseases. Mimivirus, shown in the Figure 7.17, is the largest known virus, with a diameter of 400 nm. Protein filaments measuring 100 nm stick out from the surface of the virus, which increases the diameter of the virus to about 600 nm. This is bigger than a small bacterial cell. The virus appears hexagonal under an electron microscope; the viral shape is icosahedral (having 20 faces or sides). The largest known virus, called mimivirus, is so large that scientists first mistook it for a bacterium. 
It was first discovered 	  in amoeba, in 1992, and was identified as a virus in 2003. Scientists believe that mimivirus may cause certain types of pneumonia in humans. The core contains 
A, with the majority of 	  the DNA in genes, and only 10% DNA of unknown function ("junk" DNA). 
Replication 	  Viruses can replicate only by infecting a host cell. They cannot reproduce on their own. Viruses are not cells; they are a strand of genetic material within a protective protein coat called a capsid. They infect a wide variety of organisms, including both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Once inside the cell, they use the cell’s ATP, ribosomes, enzymes, and other cellular parts to replicate. 
Habitats 	  Viruses can be found almost anywhere there is life, including living within prokaryotes. A phage is a virus that infects prokaryotes. Phages are estimated to be the most widely distributed and diverse entities in the biosphere, even more numerous than prokaryotic organisms. Phages can be found everywhere their hosts are found, such as in soil, in the intestine of animals, or seawater. Up to 109 virions have been found in a milliliter of seawater, and up to including fermented vegetables and meats, where they control the growth of bacteria.

Is this a cell or a virus? It is actually a representation of the HIV virus, the virus that causes AIDS. All the little “knobs” on the outside of the virus help to give the virus structure. And it is this structure that must be identified by a vaccine. 
Structure of  Viruses 	  Viruses vary in their structure. A virus particle consists of DNA or RNA within a protective protein coat called a capsid. The shape of the capsid may vary from one type of virus to another. The capsid is made from the proteins that are encoded by viral genes within their genome. The shape of the capsid serves as one basis for classification of viruses. The capsid of the virus shown in Figure phospholipids and proteins. The envelope is made from portions of the host’s cell membrane. It surrounds the capsid and helps protect the virus from the host’s immune system. The envelope may also have receptor molecules that can bind with host cells. They make it easier for the virus to infect the cells. 
Helical  Viruses 	  Helical capsids are made up of a single type of protein subunit stacked around a central axis to form a helical Diagram of a Cytomegalovirus. The capsid encloses the genetic material of the virus. The envelope which surrounds the capsid is typically made from portions of the host cell membranes (phospholipids and proteins). Not all viruses have a viral envelope. structure. The helix may have a hollow center, which makes it look like a hollow tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions. These virions can be anything from short and very rigid, to long and very flexible. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is an example of a helical virus, as seen in the Figure 7.19. A helical virus, tobacco mosaic virus. Although their diameter may be very small, some helical viruses can be quite long, as shown here. 1. Nucleic acid; 2. Viral protein units, 3. Capsid. TMV causes tobacco mosaic disease in tobacco, cucumber, pepper, and tomato plants. 
Icosahedral  Viruses 	  Icosahedral capsid symmetry gives viruses a spherical appearance at low magnification, but the protein subunits are actually arranged in a regular geometrical pattern, similar to a soccer ball; they are not truly spherical. An icosahedral shape is the most efficient way of creating a hardy structure from multiple copies of a single protein. This shape is used because it can be built from a single basic unit protein which is used over and over again. This saves space in the viral genome. 
Adenovirus, an icosahedral virus.  An 	  icosahedron is a three-dimensional shape made up of 20 equilateral triangles. Viral structures are built of repeated identical protein subunits, making the icosahedron the easiest shape to assemble using these subunits. 
Complex  Viruses 	  Complex viruses possess a capsid which is neither purely helical, nor purely icosahedral, and which may have extra structures such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Viral protein subunits will self-assemble into a capsid, but the complex viruses DNA also codes for proteins which help in building the viral capsid. Many phage viruses are complex-shaped; they have an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail. The tail may have a base plate with protein tail fibers. Some complex viruses do not have tail fibers. 
Enveloped  Viruses 	  Some viruses are able to surround (envelop) themselves in a portion of the cell membrane of their host. The virus can use either the outer membrane of the host cell, or an internal membrane such as the nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. In this way the virus gains an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by both the viral genome and the host genome. However, the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present come entirely from the host cell. The influenza virus, HIV, and the varicella zoster virus ( Figure 7.22) are enveloped viruses. The viral envelope can give a virus some advantages over other capsid-only viruses. For example, they have better protection from the host’s immune system, enzymes and certain chemicals. The proteins in the envelope can include glycoproteins, which act as receptor molecules. These receptor molecules allow host cells to recognize and bind the virions, which may result in easier uptake of the virion into the cell. Most enveloped viruses depend on their

Classification of  Viruses 	  Like the classification systems for cellular organisms, virus classification is the subject of ongoing debate. This is largely due to the nature of viruses, which are not living organisms by the classic definition, but neither are they necessarily non-living. Therefore, viruses do not fit neatly into the biological classification system of cellular organisms, as plants and animals do. Virus classification is based mainly on characteristics of the viral particles, including the capsid shape, the type of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA, double stranded (ds) or single stranded (ss)) within the capsid, the process of replication, their host organisms, or the type of disease they cause. The Table 7.3 lists characteristics such as capsid shape, presence of an envelope, and the diseases the viruses can cause.

Summary 	  • Viruses can be classified on the basis of capsid shape, presence or absence of an envelope, and type of nucleic acid. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Classification of Viruses at URL . • Define bacteriophage. • Outline the discovery of viruses. • Summarize the two main hypotheses of viral origin. Can you "discover" something without actually seeing it? Well, yes you can, and that’s precisely how viruses were discovered. Viruses are much smaller than bacteria, so special microscopes are needed to see them, but the existence of viruses was known prior to the development of these special microscopes. 
Discovery and  Origin of  Viruses 	  Viruses are so small that they can be seen only with an electron microscope. Before electron microscopes were invented, scientists knew viruses must exist. How did they know? They had demonstrated that particles smaller than bacteria cause disease. 
Discovery of  Viruses 	  Researchers used special filters to remove bacteria from tissues that were infected. If bacteria were causing the infection, the filtered tissues should no longer be able to make other organisms sick. However, the filtered tissues remained infective. This meant that something even smaller than bacteria was causing the infection. Scientists did not actually see viruses for the first time until the 1930s. That’s when the electron microscope was invented. In 1915, English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered bacteriophage, the viruses that attack bacteria. He noticed tiny clear spots within bacterial colonies, and hypothesized that something was killing the bacteria. The tobacco mosaic virus shown in Figure 7.23 was the first one to be seen. Tobacco Mosaic Virus. This tobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be discovered. 
It was first seen with an electron 	  microscope in 1935. 
Origin of  Viruses 	  Where did viruses come from? How did the first viruses arise? The answers to these questions are not known for certain. Several hypotheses have been proposed. The two main hypotheses are stated below. Both may be valid and explain the origin of different viruses. • Small viruses started as runaway pieces of nucleic acid that originally came from living cells such as bacteria. • Large viruses were once parasitic cells inside bigger host cells. Over time, genes needed to survive and reproduce outside host cells were lost. 
Summary 	  • Viruses were assumed to exist before they were first seen with an electron microscope in the 1930s. • Multiple hypotheses for viral origins have been proposed. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Discovery of Viruses at URL . • Explain how viruses replicate. • Distinguish between replication of a DNA virus and RNA virus. • Define reverse transcriptase. Notice the viruses sitting on the bacteria? Why is the virus sitting here? Remember, viruses are not living. So how do they replicate? 
Replication of  Viruses 	  Populations of viruses do not grow through cell division because they are not cells. Instead, they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce new copies of themselves. After infecting a host cell, a virion uses the cell’s ribosomes, enzymes, ATP, and other components to replicate. Viruses vary in how they do this. For example: • Some RNA viruses are translated directly into viral proteins in ribosomes of the host cell. The host ribosomes treat the viral RNA as though it were the host’s own mRNA. • Some DNA viruses are first transcribed in the host cell into viral mRNA. Then the viral mRNA is translated by host cell ribosomes into viral proteins. In either case, the newly made viral proteins assemble to form new virions. The virions may then direct the production of an enzyme that breaks down the host cell wall. This allows the virions to burst out of the cell. The host cell is destroyed in the process. The newly released virus particles are free to infect other cells of the host. 
Replication of  A  Viruses 	  An RNA virus is a virus that has RNA as its genetic material. Their nucleic acid is usually single-stranded RNA, but may be double-stranded RNA. Important human pathogenic RNA viruses include the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, Influenza virus, and Hepatitis C virus. Animal RNA viruses can be placed into different groups depending on their type of replication. • Some RNA viruses have their genome used directly as if it were mRNA. The viral RNA is translated directly into new viral proteins after infection by the virus. • Some RNA viruses carry enzymes which allow their RNA genome to act as a template for the host cell to a form viral mRNA. • Retroviruses use DNA intermediates to replicate. Reverse transcriptase, a viral enzyme that comes from the virus itself, converts the viral RNA into a complementary strand of DNA, which is copied to produce a double stranded molecule of viral DNA. This viral DNA is then transcribed and translated by the host machinery, directing the formation of new virions. Normal transcription involves the synthesis of RNA from DNA; hence, reverse transcription is the reverse of this process. This is an exception to the central dogma of molecular biology. 
Replication of  A  Viruses 	  A DNA virus is a virus that has DNA as its genetic material and replicates using a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The nucleic acid is usually double-stranded DNA but may also be single-stranded DNA. The DNA of DNA viruses is transcribed into mRNA by the host cell. The viral mRNA is then translated into viral proteins. These viral proteins then assemble to form new viral particles. 
Reverse- Transcribing  Viruses 	  A reverse-transcribing virus is any virus which replicates using reverse transcription, the formation of DNA from an RNA template. Some reverse-transcribing viruses have genomes made of single-stranded RNA and use a DNA intermediate to replicate. Others in this group have genomes that have double-stranded DNA and use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. The retroviruses, as mentioned above, are included in this group, of which HIV is a member. Some double-stranded DNA viruses replicate using reverse transcriptase. The hepatitis B virus is one of these viruses. 
Bacteriophages 	  Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. They bind to surface receptor molecules of the bacterial cell and then their genome enters the cell. The protein coat does not enter the bacteria. Within a short amount of time, in some cases, just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane. With some phages, just over twenty minutes after the phage infects the bacterium, over three hundred phages can be assembled and released from the host.

Viral or bacterial? Doesn’t look like fun. The flu is caused by an influenza virus. And usually a slightly different virus every season. 
Viruses and  Human  Disease 	  Viruses cause many human diseases. In addition to the flu and HIV, viruses cause rabies, measles, diarrheal diseases, hepatitis, polio, cold sores and other diseases (see Figure 7.24). Viral diseases range from mild to fatal. One way viruses cause disease is by causing host cells to burst open and die. Viruses may also cause disease without killing host cells. They may cause illness by disrupting homeostasis in host cells. Some viruses live in a dormant state inside the body. This is called latency. For example, the virus that causes chicken pox may infect a young child and cause the short-term disease chicken pox. Then the virus may remain latent in nerve cells within the body for decades. The virus may re-emerge later in life as the disease called shingles. In shingles, the virus causes painful skin rashes with blisters (see Figure 7.25). Some viruses can cause cancer. For example, human papillomavirus (HPV) causes cancer of the cervix in females. Hepatitis B virus causes cancer of the liver. A viral cancer is likely to develop only after a person has been infected with a virus for many years. 
Cold  Sore.  Cold sores are caused by a 	  herpes virus. 
Shingles.  Shingles is a disease caused by 	  the same virus that causes chicken pox. 
The  Flu 	  Influenza, or flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Influenza spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics. An epidemic is an outbreak of a disease within a population of people during a specific time. Every year in the United States, about 200,000 people are hospitalized and 36,000 people die from the flu. Flu pandemics can kill millions of people. A pandemic is an epidemic that spreads through human populations across a large region (for example a continent), or even worldwide. Three influenza pandemics occurred in the 20th century and killed tens of millions of people, with each of these pandemics being caused by the appearance of a new strain of the virus. Most influenza strains can be inactivated easily by disinfectants and detergents. 
Emerging  Viral  Diseases 	  Modern modes of transportation allow more people and products to travel around the world at a faster pace. They also open the airways to the transcontinental movement of infectious disease vectors. One example of this occurring is West Nile Virus, which scientists believe was introduced to the United States by an infected air traveler. With the use of air travel, people are able to go to foreign lands, contract a disease and not have any symptoms of illness until they get home, possibly exposing others to the disease along the way. See Virus Crisis at URL watch?v=91b3MCAlYSI for additional information. Often, new diseases result from the spread of an existing disease from animals to humans. A disease that can be spread from animals to humans is called a zoonosis. When a disease breaks out, scientists called epidemiologists investigate the outbreak, looking for its cause. Epidemiologists are like detectives trying to solve a crime. The information epidemiologists learn is important to understand the pathogen, and help prevent future outbreaks of disease. A deadly strain of avian flu virus named H5N1 has posed the greatest risk for a new influenza pandemic since it first killed humans in Asia in the 1990s. The virus is passed from infected birds to humans. Fortunately, the virus has not mutated to a form that spreads easily between people. Several lethal viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever have been discovered, two of which are shown in the Figure hosts of the viruses are thought to be apes in west central Africa, but the virus has also been isolated from bats in the same region. The Ebola virus (left), and Marburg virus (right), are viruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers that can cause multiple organ failure and death. People get exposed to new and rare zoonoses when they move into new areas and encounter wild animals. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS) is a respiratory disease which is caused by the SARS coronavirus. An outbreak in China in 2003 was linked to the handling and consumption of wild civet cats sold as food in a market. In 2005, two studies identified a number of SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese bats. It is likely that the virus spread from bats to civets, and then to humans. 
Ebola 	  Ebola is a rare and deadly disease caused by infection with a strain of Ebola virus. The 2014 Ebola epidemic is the largest in history, affecting multiple countries in West Africa, including Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Ebola is spread through direct contact with blood and body fluids of a person infected by and already showing symptoms of Ebola. Ebola is not spread through the air, water, food, or mosquitoes. See Ebola virus disease at URL nt/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/ for additional information.

It is the constant changing of those outside markers that make producing a vaccine against this virus difficult. 
 	  The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic, with an estimated (as of 2008) people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at URL . HIV is the retrovirus that destroys the immune system. HIV primarily infects helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells because the virus directly kills infected cells and the infected T cells are also attacked by the immune system. The infection of a CD4 cell is shown in the Figure 7.27. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a certain critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes more prone to opportunistic infections. HIV infections will be discussed further in the immune system concepts. If left untreated, most HIV-infected individuals will develop AIDS. AIDS is a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the damage to the immune system by HIV. Because the immune systems of people with AIDS are so weak, bacteria and viruses that do not normally cause disease in healthy people can easily cause disease in an AIDS patient. Opportunistic infections associated with AIDS include: • Pneumocystis pneumonia: a form of pneumonia caused by a fungus. • Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. • Lung infections caused by Mycobacterium other than tuberculosis (MOTT). • Kaposi’s sarcoma: a type of cancer that is caused by Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).

(vDNA). carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase. This integrated viral DNA may then lie dormant, during the latent stage of the HIV infection. Clinical latency for HIV can vary between two weeks and 20 years. are plentiful in activated T cells. This means that those cells most likely to be killed by HIV are those currently fighting infection. The virus DNA is transcribed to mRNA which then leads to new virus protein and genome production. from the cell’s plasma membrane. The cycle begins again when the new particles infect another cell. HIV infection is treated with a cocktail of several antiretroviral drugs. The antiretroviral drugs prevent the virus from replicating and destroying more T cells, thus preventing the patients from developing AIDS. Treatment with antiretroviral drugs can dramatically increase the life expectancy of people with HIV.

What’s the best part of going to the doctor? Most people don’t like having a shot at the doctor’s office. But these are necessary. They protect you from some very dangerous viruses. 
Control of  Viruses 	  People have been able to control the spread of viruses even before they knew they existed. In 1717, Mary Montagu, the wife of an English ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, observed local women inoculating their children against smallpox, a contagious viral disease that was often deadly. Inoculation involves introducing a small amount of virus into a person’s body to allow their body to build up immunity to the virus. This early smallpox inoculation involved putting smallpox crusts into the nostril of a healthy person. 
Vaccines 	  Because viruses use the machinery of a host cell to reproduce and stay within them, they are difficult to get rid of without killing the host cell. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of viruses. A vaccine is a mixture of antigenic material and other immune stimulants that will produce immunity to a certain pathogen or disease. The term "vaccine" comes from Edward Jenner’s use of cowpox (vacca means cow in Latin), to immunize people against smallpox. The material in the vaccine can either be weakened forms of a living pathogen or virus, dead pathogens (or inactivated viruses), purified material such as viral proteins, or genetically engineered pieces of a pathogen. The material in the vaccine will cause the body to mount an immune response, so the person will develop immunity to the disease. Smallpox was the first disease people tried to prevent by purposely inoculating themselves with other types of infections such as cowpox. Vaccination is an effective way of preventing viral infections. Vaccinations can be given in schools, shown in the Figure 7.28, health clinics, and even at home. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as polio, measles, mumps, and rubella. Genetically engineered vaccines are produced through recombinant DNA technology. Most new vaccines are produced with this technology. A young student receives a vaccine. A worldwide vaccination campaign by the World Health Organization led to the eradication of smallpox in 1979. Smallpox is a contagious disease unique to humans and is caused by two Variola viruses. The eradication of smallpox was possible because humans are the only carriers of the virus. To this day, smallpox is the only human infectious disease to have been completely eradicated from nature. Scientists are hoping to eradicate polio next. 
Antiviral  Drugs 	  While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon, a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. Like antibiotics, specific antivirals are used for specific viruses. They are relatively harmless to the host, and therefore can be used to treat infections. Most of the antiviral drugs now available are designed to help deal with HIV and herpes viruses. Antivirals are also available for the influenza viruses and the Hepatitis B and C viruses, which can cause liver cancer. Antiviral drugs are often imitation DNA building blocks which viruses incorporate into their genomes during replication. The life cycle of the virus is then halted because the newly synthesized DNA is inactive. Similar to antibiotics, antivirals are subject to drug resistance as the pathogens evolve to survive exposure to the treatment. HIV evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins on the surface of the virion. Researchers are now working to extend the range of antivirals to other families of pathogens. 
Summary 	  • Several viral diseases can be treated with antiviral drugs or prevented with vaccines. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Questions and Answers on the Use of HIV Medications to Help Prevent the Transmission of HIV at http ://URL . • Identify how viruses are used in research and medicine. • Distinguish between a viral vector and a phage. • Distinguish between viral therapy and gene therapy. Can viruses be helpful, or just harmful? Viruses are extensively used in research and medicine to both understand basic biology and to improve human health. Imagine having a tool that is able to inject its DNA into a host cell. The possibilities of using such a tool are endless. That tool would be a virus. 
Viruses in  Research 	  Viruses are an extremely important tool in the study of molecular and cellular biology. Since viruses infect cells by moving their genetic material into the host cell’s nucleus, they are helpful in the investigation of the functions of cells. For example, the use of viruses in research has helped our understanding of the basics of molecular genetics, such as DNA replication, transcription, RNA processing, translation, protein transport, and immunology. 
Viruses and  Medicine 	  Geneticists often use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells that they are studying. A viral vector is a tool commonly used by molecular biologists to place genetic material into cells. To be a useful viral vector, the virus is modified so that it will not cause disease, and it will infect only certain types of cells. Phages are often used as vectors to genetically modify bacteria. In a similar fashion, viral therapy uses viruses to genetically modify diseased cells and tissues. Viral therapy shows promise as a method of gene therapy and in the treatment of cancer. Gene therapy is the insertion of genes into a person’s cells and tissues to treat a disease. In the case of a genetic disease, the defective gene is replaced with a working gene. Although the technology is still new, it has been used with some success. Scientists have focused on gene therapy for diseases caused by single-gene defects, such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia. In gene therapy, the correct version of the gene is introduced to human cells by using a viral vector such as the adenovirus shown in the Figure 7.29. Phages have been used for over 60 years as an alternative to antibiotics in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. They are seen as a hope against multi-drug-resistant strains of many bacteria because they can infect and kill these “superbugs”. However, in the case of MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), a phage infecting the bacterium produces a toxin that makes the bacterium more virulent and difficult to contain. Viruses that infect cancer cells are being studied for their use in cancer treatments. Oncolytic viruses are viruses that lyse and kill cancer cells. Some researchers are hoping to treat some cancers with these viruses. Gene therapy using an Adenovirus vector. 
A new gene is inserted into an adenovirus 	  vector, which is used to introduce the modified DNA into a human cell. 
If the 	  treatment is successful, the new gene will get into the nucleus and into the target cell DNA to make a functional protein.

Introduction 	  Would you eat this mushroom? Now that’s an interesting mushroom! In fact, fungi can be some of the most colorful species. And protists can be some of the most interesting. These two kingdoms which have some of the most diverse members are the first two eukaryotic kingdoms we discuss in the Protists and Fungi chapter. This quintessential toadstool, the fly agaric or fly Amanita, is a poisonous and psychoactive fungus. 
It has a 	  large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually deep red mushroom, and it is one of the most recognizable and widely encountered in popular culture. You should not eat it. • Describe the protist kingdom. Prokaryote or eukaryote? This organism consists of a single cell with several flagella. Is it a prokaryote, such as a bacterium? Actually, it’s larger than a prokaryotic cell, and it also has a nucleus. Therefore, this organism belongs to the domain Eukarya, the domain that includes humans. This particular eukaryote is one of the smallest, simplest organisms in the domain, called a protist. It’s scientific name is Giardia lamblia. As a human parasite, it can make us sick. 
Kingdom  Protista 	  Protists are a group of all the eukaryotes that are not fungi, animals, or plants. As a result, it is a very diverse group of organisms. The eukaryotes that make up this kingdom, Kingdom Protista, do not have much in common besides a relatively simple organization. Protists can look very different from each other. Some are tiny and unicellular, like an amoeba, and some are large and multicellular, like seaweed. However, multicellular protists do not have highly specialized tissues or organs. This simple cellular-level organization distinguishes protists from other eukaryotes, such as fungi, animals, and plants. There are thought to be between 60,000 and 200,000 protist species, and many have yet to be identified. Protists live in almost any environment that contains liquid water. Many protists, such as the algae, are photosynthetic and are vital primary producers in ecosystems. Other protists are responsible for a range of serious human diseases, such as malaria and sleeping sickness. The term protista was first used by Ernst Haeckel in 1866. Protists were traditionally placed into one of several the animal-like protozoa, the plant-like protophyta groups based on similarities to a plant, animal, or fungus: (mostly algae), and the fungus-like slime molds and water molds. These traditional subdivisions, which were largely based on non-scientific characteristics, have been replaced by classifications based on phylogenetics (evolutionary relatedness among organisms). However, the older terms are still used as informal names to describe the general characteristics of various protists. Protists range from single-celled amoebas to multicellular seaweed. Protists may be similar to animals, plants, or fungi. 
Summary 	  • Kingdom Protista includes all eukaryotes that are not animals, plants, or fungi. • Kingdom Protista is very diverse. It consists of both single-celled and multicellular organisms. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Kingdom Protista at URL . • Outline the evolution of protists. • Explain the formation of the first eukaryotic cells. • Site evidence for the endosymbiotic theory. What’s the difference between a bacterium and a simple protist? Were simple protists the first eukaryotic organisms to evolve? Probably. A protist is a eukaryote, so each cell has a nucleus. Otherwise, simple protists, like the Paramecium and amoeba, can be fairly similar to bacteria. 
Evolution of  Protists 	  Scientists think that protists are the oldest eukaryotes. If so, they must have evolved from prokaryotic cells. How did this happen? The endosymbiotic theory provides the most widely-accepted explanation. That’s because it is well supported by evidence. 
The  First  Eukaryotic  Cells 	  According to the endosymbiotic theory, the first eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiotic relationship between two or more prokaryotic cells. Smaller prokaryotic cells were engulfed by (or invaded) larger prokaryotic cells. The small cells (now called endosymbionts) benefited from the relationship by getting a safe home and nutrients. The large cells (now called hosts) benefited by getting some of the organic molecules or energy released by the endosymbionts. Eventually, the endosymbionts evolved into organelles of the host cells. After that, neither could live without the other. As shown in Figure 8.2, some of the endosymbionts were aerobic bacteria. They were specialized to break down chemicals and release energy. They evolved into the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. Some of the small cells were cyanobacteria. They were specialized for photosynthesis. They evolved into the chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells. Endosymbiotic theory explains how eukaryotic cells arose. 
Evidence for the  Endosymbiotic  Theory 	  Many pieces of evidence support the endosymbiotic theory. For example: • Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA that is different from the DNA found in the cell nucleus. Instead, it is similar to the circular DNA of bacteria. • Mitochondria and chloroplasts are surrounded by their own plasma membranes, which are similar to bacterial membranes. • New mitochondria and chloroplasts are produced through a process similar to binary fission. Bacteria also reproduce through binary fission. • The internal structure and biochemistry of chloroplasts is very similar to that of cyanobacteria. 
Summary 	  • Scientists think that protists are the oldest eukaryotes. • Protists most likely evolved from prokaryotic cells, as explained by the endosymbiotic theory. This theory is well-supported by evidence. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • It Takes Teamwork: How Endosymbiosis Changed Life on Earth at URL rary/article/endosymbiosis_01 . • Identify protist characteristics. • List protist habitats. • Describe forms of protist motility. • Explain protist reproduction. • Summarize protist nutrition. Sexual or asexual reproduction for protists? Notice how the Paramecium is dividing into two cells. This, obviously, is a form of asexual reproduction. But, remember that protists are an extremely diverse kingdom, and some protists can also reproduce sexually. 
Characteristics of  Protists 	  Like all other eukaryotes, protists have a nucleus containing their DNA. They also have other membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Most protists are single-celled. Some are multicellular. Because the protist kingdom is so diverse, their ways of getting food and reproducing vary widely. 
Protist  Habitats 	  Most protists are aquatic organisms. They need a moist environment to survive. They are found mainly in damp soil, marshes, puddles, lakes, and the ocean. Some protists are free-living organisms. Others are involved in symbiotic relationships. They live in or on other organisms, including humans. 
Motility of  Protists 	  Most protists have motility. This is the ability to move. Protists have three types of appendages for movement. As shown in Figure 8.3, they may have flagella, cilia, or pseudopods (“false feet”). There may be one or more whiplike flagella. Cilia are similar to flagella, except they are shorter and there are more of them. They may completely cover the surface of the protist cell. Pseudopods are temporary, foot-like extensions of the cytoplasm. 
Protists use cilia, pseudopods, or flagella 	  to move. 
Protist  Reproduction 	  Protists have complex life cycles. Many have both asexual and sexual reproduction. An example is a protist called Spirogyra, a type of algae, shown Figure 8.4. It usually exists as haploid cells that reproduce by binary fission. In a stressful environment, such as one that is very dry, Spirogyra may produce tough spores that can withstand harsh conditions. Spores are reproductive cells produced by protists and various other organisms. If two protist spores are close together, they can fuse to form a diploid zygote. This is a type of sexual reproduction. The zygote then undergoes meiosis, producing haploid cells that repeat the cycle. Spirogyra is a genus of algae with a complex life cycle. Each organism consists of rectangular cells connected end-to-end in long filaments. 
Protist  Nutrition 	  Protists get food in one of three ways. They may ingest, absorb, or make their own organic molecules. • Ingestive protists ingest, or engulf, bacteria and other small particles. They extend their cell wall and cell membrane around the food item, forming a food vacuole. Then enzymes digest the food in the vacuole. • Absorptive protists absorb food molecules across their cell membranes. This occurs by diffusion. These protists are important decomposers. • Photosynthetic protists use light energy to make food. They are major producers in aquatic ecosystems. 
Summary 	  • Protists have nuclear membranes around their DNA. They also have other membrane-bound organelles. • Many protists live in aquatic habitats, and most are motile, or able to move. • Protists have complex life cycles that may include both sexual and asexual reproduction. • Protists get food through ingestion, absorption, or photosynthesis. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Characteristics of Protists at URL . • Describe animal-like protists. • Describe the position of protozoa in food chains. • Summarize the classification of protozoa. What’s like an animal, but not an animal? An animal-like protist, or a protozoa. These protists have the ability to move, usually with some sort of cilia or flagella, and must obtain their energy from other sources. But obviously, they are much simpler than animals. 
Animal- Like  Protists:  Protozoa 	  Animal-like protists are commonly called protozoa (singular, protozoan). Most protozoa consist of a single cell. They are animal-like because they are heterotrophs, and are capable of moving. Although protozoa are not animals, they are thought to be the ancestors of animals. 
Ecology of  Protozoa 	  Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations under control. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. Protozoa are also important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. 
Classification of  Protozoa 	  Protozoa can be classified on the basis of how they move. As shown in Table 8.1, protozoa move in three different ways. Only sporozoa cannot move. Note that this classification is based only on differences in movement. It does not represent phylogenetic relationships. 
How  It  Moves 	  pseudopods Example (Genus) 
Ciliate 	  cilia

Summary 	  • Animal-like protists are called protozoa. Most consist a single cell. • Like animals, protozoa are heterotrophic and capable of moving. • Examples of protozoa include amoebas and paramecia. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Protozoa at URL . • Give an overview of plant-like protists. • Give examples of algae. • Explain why are algae considered plant-like. • Describe the role of algae in the food chain. • Summarize the classification of algae. • Explain the life cycles of algae. Many people, if not most, believe seaweed to be a plant. Is it? Seaweed is actually a plant-like protist, which are also known as algae. The green color is due to what pigment? Algae, like plants, obtain their energy through photosynthesis. 
Plant- Like  Protists:  Algae 	  Plant-like protists are called algae (singular, alga). They are a large and diverse group. Some algae, the diatoms, are single-celled. Others, such as seaweed, are multicellular (see Figure 8.5). Why are algae considered plant-like? The main reason is that they contain chloroplasts and produce food through photosynthesis. However, they lack many other structures of true plants. For example, algae do not have roots, stems, or leaves. Some algae also differ from plants in being motile. They may move with pseudopods or flagella. Although not plants themselves, algae were probably the ancestors of plants. Diatoms are single-celled algae. Other forms of algae are multicellular. 
Ecology of  Algae 	  Algae play significant roles as producers in aquatic ecosystems. Microscopic forms live suspended in the water column. They are the main component of phytoplankton. As such, they contribute to the food base of most marine ecosystems. Multicellular seaweeds called kelp may grow as large as trees. They are the food base of ecosystems called kelp forests (see Figure 8.6). Kelp forests are found throughout the ocean in temperate and arctic climates. They are highly productive ecosystems. Kelp Forest. This kelp forest supports a large community of many other types of organisms. 
Classification of  Algae 	  Types of algae include red and green algae, and euglenids, and dinoflagellates (see Table 8.2 for examples). Scientists think that red and green algae evolved from endosymbiotic relationships with cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts have two membranes because the cell membranes of the cyanobacteria became additional plasma membranes of the chloroplasts. Scientists think that euglenids and dinoflagellates evolved later, from endosymbiotic relationships with green and red algae. This is why their chloroplasts have three membranes. Differences in the types of chlorophyll in the four types of algae also support the hypothesized evolutionary relationships. 
Origin of  Chloroplast 	  cyanobacteria 
Type of  Chloroplast 	  two membranes, chlorophyll the majority of cyanobacteria like 
Green algae 	  cyanobacteria two membranes, chlorophyll like a minority of cyanobacteria 
Euglenids 	  green algae three membranes, chlorophyll like green algae 
Dinoflagellates 	  red algae three membranes, chlorophyll like red algae 
Reproduction of  Algae 	  Algae have varied life cycles. Two examples are shown in Figure 8.7. Both cycles include phases of asexual reproduction (haploid, n) and sexual reproduction (diploid, 2n). Why go to so much trouble to reproduce? Asexual reproduction is fast, but it doesn’t create new genetic variation. Sexual reproduction is more complicated and risky, but it creates new gene combinations. Each strategy may work better under different conditions. Rapid population growth (asexual reproduction) is adaptive when conditions are favorable. Genetic variation (sexual reproduction) helps ensure that some organisms will survive if the environment changes. 
D:  Algae  Power 	  QUEST explores the potential of algae-–once considered nothing more than pond scum—to become the fuel of the future. Entrepreneurs from throughout California are working to create the next generation of biofuels from algae. But will you ever be able to run your car off it? See URL for additional information.

Summary 	  • Plant-like protists are called algae. They include single-celled diatoms and multicellular seaweed. • Like plants, algae contain chlorophyll and make food by photosynthesis. • Types of algae include red and green algae, euglenids, and dinoflagellates. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Algae at URL . • Identify types of fungus-like protists. • Give an overview of molds. • Compare slime molds to water molds. What grows just about anywhere there is decaying material? Mold. This slime mold, shown growing on dead wood, is a fungus-like protist. Though this mold does not have a mouth, essentially it is still “eating” this decaying material. 
Fungus- Like  Protists:  Molds 	  Fungus-like protists are molds. They are absorptive feeders on decaying organic matter. They resemble fungi, and they reproduce with spores as fungi do. However, in other ways, they are quite different from fungi and more like other protists. For example, they have cell walls made of cellulose, whereas fungi have cell walls made of chitin. Like other protists, they have complicated life cycles with both asexual and sexual reproduction. They are motile during some stages of their life cycle. Two major types of fungus-like protists are slime molds and water molds. 
Slime  Molds 	  Slime molds are fungus-like protists commonly found on rotting logs and compost. They move very slowly in search of decaying matter to eat. When food is scarce, individual cells swarm together to form a blob-like mass, like the “dog vomit” slime mold in the Figure 8.8. The mass glides along on its own secretions, engulfing decaying organic matter as it moves over it. There are two types of slime molds when it comes to how they swarm: acellular and cellular. “Dog Vomit” Slime Mold. This slime mold looks like its name. • When acellular slime molds swarm, they fuse together to form a single cell with many nuclei. • When cellular slime molds swarm, they remain as distinct cells. Cellular slime molds are used as model organisms in molecular biology and genetics. They may be the key to how multicellular organisms evolved. Can you explain why? 
Water  Molds 	  Water molds are commonly found in moist soil and surface water. Many are plant pathogens that destroy crops. They infect plants such as grapes, lettuce, corn, and potatoes. Some water molds are parasites of fish and other aquatic organisms.

Can such little creatures make you sick? They sure can. Not all of them, but some of them. And without proper medical treatment, the person may never recover. 
Protists and  Human  Disease 	  Most protist diseases in humans are caused by animal-like protists, or protozoa. Protozoa make us sick when they become human parasites. Three examples of parasitic protozoa are described below. Members of the genus Trypanosoma are flagellate protozoa that cause sleeping sickness, which is common in Africa. They also cause Chagas disease, which is common in South America. The parasites are spread by insect vectors. The vector for Chagas disease is shown in Figure 8.9. Trypanosoma parasites enter a person’s blood when the vector bites. Then they spread to other tissues and organs. The diseases may be fatal without medical treatment. The discovery of Chagas disease is unique in the history of medicine. That’s because a single researcher—a Brazilian physician named Carlos Chagas—single-handedly identified and explained the new infectious disease. In the early transmission of the disease that is now named for him. 
Vector for  Chagas  Disease.  In  Chagas disease, the  Trypanosoma parasite 	  is spread by an insect commonly called the “kissing bug.” A bite from this bug could be the kiss of death. Giardia are flagellate protozoa that cause giardiasis. The parasites enter the body through food or water that has been contaminated by feces of infected people or animals. The protozoa attach to the lining of the host’s small intestine, where they prevent the host from fully absorbing nutrients. They may also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. A picture of a Giardia protozoan opens this concept. Plasmodium protozoa cause malaria. The parasites are spread by a mosquito vector. Parasites enter a host’s blood through the bite of an infected mosquito. The parasites infect the host’s red blood cells, causing symptoms such as fever, joint pain, anemia, and fatigue. Malaria is common in tropical and subtropical climates throughout the world (see Figure 8.10). In fact, malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases on the planet. Malaria is also a very serious disease. 
It kills 	  several million people each year, most of them children. A vaccine to malaria is a possibility. See Vaccine Could Become ’Another Very Powerful Weapon’ to Fight Malaria at URL for additional information.

How do you think Terri became infected? • Describe the main characteristics of fungi. • Give examples of fungi. • Describe habitats of fungi. What exactly is a fungus? They’re not animals or plants, and definitely not protists. So they cannot photosynthesize or eat. And they are much more than mushrooms. 
Characteristics of  Fungi 	  Do you see the organisms growing on the bread in the Figure 8.11? They belong to the Kingdom Fungi. Molds growing on foods are some of the most common fungi in our everyday lives. These organisms may seem useless, gross, and costly. But fungi play very important roles in almost every terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Fungi (singular, fungus) are a kingdom in the domain Eukarya. The fungi kingdom may contain more than a million species, but fewer than 100,000 have been identified. As shown in the Figure 8.12, fungi include mushrooms and yeasts in addition to molds. Most fungi are multicellular, but some exist as single cells. Single-celled fungi are known as yeasts. Fungi spend most of their life cycle in the haploid state. They form diploid cells only during sexual reproduction. Like the cells of protists and plants, the cells of fungi have cell walls. But fungi are unique in having cell walls made of chitin instead of cellulose. Chitin is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the exoskeleton (outer skeleton) of insects and related organisms. The mold growing on this bread is a common fungus. 
Several examples of fungi are pictured 	  here. 
Habitats of  Fungi 	  Fungi are found all around the world, and grow in a wide range of habitats, including deserts. Most grow in terrestrial environments, but several species live only in aquatic habitats. Most fungi live in soil or dead matter, and in symbiotic relationships with plants, animals, or other fungi. Fungi, along with bacteria that are found in soil, are the primary decomposers of organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems. The decomposition of dead organisms returns nutrient to the soil, and the environment. 
Summary 	  • Fungi are a kingdom in the domain Eukarya that includes molds, mushrooms, and yeasts. • Most fungi are multicellular. They are unique in having cell walls made of chitin. • Most fungi live on dead matter or soil. Some live in aquatic habitats. Many are involved in symbiotic relationships. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Fungi at URL . • The Fungi Kingdom at URL . • Outline the structure of fungi. • Define hyphae and mycelium. • Explain the significance of a fruiting body. Is the structure important? Of course. Though mushrooms may be the most common type of fungus, fungi also include rusts, smuts, puffballs, truffles, morels, molds, and yeasts, as well as many less well-known organisms. And, except for yeast cells, they all have similar structures, which are usually hidden deep within their food source. 
Structure of  Fungi 	  Except for yeasts, which grow as single cells, most fungi grow as thread-like filaments, like those shown in Figure tubular cell wall. A mass of hyphae make up the body of a fungus, which is called a mycelium (plural, mycelia). The hyphae of most fungi are divided into cells by internal walls called septa (singular, septum). Septa usually have little pores that are large enough to allow ribosomes, mitochondria and sometimes nuclei to flow among cells. Hyphae that are divided into cells are called septate hyphae. However, the hyphae of some fungi are not separated by septa. Hyphae without septae are called coenocytic hyphae. Coenocytic hyphae are big, multinucleated cells. A mycelium may range in size from microscopic to very large. In fact, one of the largest living organisms on Earth is the mycelium of a single fungus. A small part of a similar fungus is pictured in Figure 8.14. The giant fungus covers 8.9 square kilometers (3.4 square miles) in an Oregon forest. That’s about the size of a small city. The fungus didn’t grow that large overnight. It’s estimated to be 2,400 years old, and it’s still growing! These branches are hyphae, or filaments, of a mold called Penicillium. 
The fungus shown here has been dubbed 	  the “humongous fungus” because it covers such a large area. 
Fruiting  Bodies 	  Some fungi become noticeable only when producing spores (fruiting), either as mushrooms or molds. For example, you can see the fruiting bodies of the Armillaria fungus in the Figure 8.14, but the large “body” of the fungus, the mycelium, is hidden underground. This fruiting body, known as the sporocarp, is a multicellular structure on which spore-producing structures form. The fruiting body is part of the sexual phase of a fungal life cycle. The rest of the life cycle is characterized by the growth of mycelia. 
Dimorphic  Fungi 	  Some fungi take on different shapes, depending on their environmental conditions. These fungi are called dimorphic fungi, because they have “two forms.” For example, the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, which causes the disease histoplasmosis, is thermally dimorphic; it has two forms that are dependent on temperature. In temperatures of about grows as single, round yeast cells.

Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Fungal Cell Structure at URL . • Relate the structure of fungi to how they obtain nutrients. • Describe mycorrhiza. So what do fungi "eat"? Just about anything. From dead plants to rotting fruit. Shown here are fungi sprouting from dead material in the woods. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange. 
Nutrition 	  Fungi get their nutrition by absorbing organic compounds from the environment. Fungi are heterotrophic: they rely solely on carbon obtained from other organisms for their metabolism and nutrition. Fungi have evolved in a way that allows many of them to use a large variety of organic substrates for growth, including simple compounds such as nitrate, ammonia, acetate, or ethanol. Their mode of nutrition defines the role of fungi in their environment. Fungi obtain nutrients in three different ways: organic matter, usually dead and decaying plant or animal matter, by absorbing soluble organic compounds. Saprotrophic fungi play very important roles as recyclers in ecosystem energy flow and biogeochemical cycles. Saprophytic fungi, such as shiitake (Lentinula edodes) and oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus), decompose dead plant and animal tissue by releasing enzymes from hyphal tips. In this way they recycle organic materials back into the surrounding environment. Because of these abilities, fungi are the primary decomposers in forests (see Figure 8.15). host. Parasitic fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may causes illness in the host. Diseasecausing fungi are parasitic. Recall that parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship between organisms of different species in which one, the parasite, benefits from a close association with the other, the host, which is harmed. Recall that mutualism is an interaction between individuals of two different species, in which both individuals benefit. Both parasitism and mutualism are classified as symbiotic relationships, but they are discussed separately here because of the different effect on the host. Forest Decomposers. These forest mushrooms may look fragile, but they do a powerful job. They decompose dead wood and other tough plant material. Fungal hyphae are adapted to efficient absorption of nutrients from their environments, because hyphae have high surface area-to-volume ratios. These adaptations are also complemented by the release of hydrolytic enzymes that break down large organic molecules such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids into smaller molecules. These molecules are then absorbed as nutrients into the fungal cells. One enzyme that is secreted by fungi is cellulase, which breaks down the polysaccharide cellulose. Cellulose is a major component of plant cell walls. In some cases, fungi have developed specialized structures for nutrient uptake from living hosts, which penetrate into the host cells for nutrient uptake by the fungus. 
Mycorrhiza 	  A mycorrhiza (Greek for "fungus roots") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. 
Summary 	  • Fungi are heterotrophic. They get their nutrition by absorbing organic compounds from the environment. 
Fungal mycelia.  Fungi absorb nutrients 	  from the environment through mycelia. 
The branching mycelia have a high 	  surface-area-to-volume ratio which allows for efficient absorption of nutrients. Some fungi digest nutrients by releasing enzymes into the environment. • Fungi, along with bacteria that are found in soil, are the primary decomposers of organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Fungus Nutrition at URL . • Explain fungi reproduction. • Describe a fungal spore. • Distinguish between a spore and a zygospore. How do fungi reproduce? Sexually or asexually? How about both? That would suggest that fungi can produce both diploid and haploid cells, which they can. Shown above are fungi mycelia and haploid spores. Spores allow fungi to reproduce through unfavorable conditions. 
Reproduction of  Fungi 	  The majority of fungi can reproduce both asexually and sexually. This allows them to adjust to conditions in the environment. They can spread quickly through asexual reproduction when conditions are stable. They can increase their genetic variation through sexual reproduction when conditions are changing and variation may help them survive. 
Asexual  Reproduction 	  Almost all fungi reproduce asexually by producing spores. A fungal spore is a haploid cell produced by mitosis from a haploid parent cell. It is genetically identical to the parent cell. Fungal spores can develop into new haploid individuals without being fertilized. Spores may be dispersed by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Some fungi even have “cannons” that “shoot” the spores far from the parent organism. This helps to ensure that the offspring will not have to compete with the parent for space or other resources. You are probably familiar with puffballs, like the one in Figure 8.17. They release a cloud of spores when knocked or stepped on. Wherever the spores happen to land, they do not germinate until conditions are favorable for growth. Then they develop into new hyphae. Puffballs release spores when disturbed. Yeasts do not produce spores. Instead, they reproduce asexually by budding. Budding is the pinching off of an offspring from the parent cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent. Budding in yeast is pictured in Figure 8.18. Yeast reproduce asexually by budding. 
Sexual  Reproduction 	  Sexual reproduction also occurs in virtually all fungi. This involves mating between two haploid hyphae. During mating, two haploid parent cells fuse, forming a diploid spore called a zygospore. The zygospore is genetically different from the parents. After the zygospore germinates, it can undergo meiosis, forming haploid cells that develop into new hyphae. 
Summary 	  • The majority of fungi can reproduce both asexually and sexually. This allows them to adjust to conditions in the environment. • Yeast reproduce asexually by budding. Other fungi reproduce asexually by producing spores. • Sexual reproduction occurs when spores from two parents fuse and form a zygospore. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Reproduction at URL ristics-of-fungi-149/reproduction-591-11810/ . • Summarize the evolution of fungi. What were early fungi like? Early fungi probably lived in water. And they were most likely single-celled organisms. Maybe they lived on dead and decaying material. Obviously, at least in overall size and structure, a mold is very different than a mushroom. Could early fungi have been similar to a mold? 
Evolution of  Fungi 	  DNA evidence suggests that almost all fungi have a single common ancestor. The earliest fungi may have evolved about 600 million years ago or even earlier. They were probably aquatic organisms with a flagellum. Fungi first colonized the land at least 460 million years ago, around the same time as plants. Fossils of terrestrial fungi date back almost 400 million years (see Figure 8.19). Starting about 250 million years ago, the fossil record shows fungi were abundant in many places. They may have been the dominant life forms on Earth at that time. 
This rock contains fossilized fungi.  The 	  fungi lived 396 million years ago in what is now Scotland. They were preserved when they were covered with lava from a volcano. The lava cooled and hardened into rock. 
Summary 	  • Almost all fungi have a single common ancestor. • The earliest fungi may have evolved about 600 million years ago. • Fungi colonized land at least 460 million years ago. • By 250 million years ago, they may have been the dominant life forms on Earth. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Fungi Evolution at URL on.htm . • Give an overview of the classification of fungi. • Give examples from the common fungi phyla. What type of fungus is this? Obviously a mold. But what type of mold? There are thousands of known species of molds. How are they classified? 
Classification of  Fungi 	  For a long time, scientists considered fungi to be members of the plant kingdom because they have obvious similarities with plants. Both fungi and plants are immobile, have cell walls, and grow in soil. Some fungi, such as lichens, even look like plants (see Figure 8.20). 
The  Kingdom  Fungi 	  Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have unique physical, chemical, and genetic traits that set them apart from plants and other eukaryotes. For example, the cell walls of fungi are made of chitin, not cellulose. Also, fungi absorb nutrients from other organisms, whereas plants make their own food. These are just a few of the reasons fungi are now placed in their own kingdom. 
Bark.  Both fungi and moss are growing 	  on this tree. Can you tell them apart? 
Fungal  Phyla 	  Classification of fungi below the level of the kingdom is controversial. There is no single, widely-accepted system of fungal classification. Most classifications include several phyla (the next major taxon below the kingdom). Three of the most common phyla are compared in Table 8.3.

Example 	  black bread mold have many different shapes, considerable variation exists even within species button mushrooms found in all terrestrial ecosystems world-wide, even in Antarctica, often involved in symbiotic relationships baker’s yeast 
Summary 	  • Fungi used to be classified as plants. Now, they are known to have unique traits that set them apart from plants. For example, fungal cell walls contain chitin, not cellulose, and fungi absorb food rather than make their own. • Below the level of the kingdom, classification of fungi is controversial. • Define parasitism and mutualism. • Identify symbiotic relationships of fungi. • Distinguish between a mycorrhiza and a lichen. Do all fungi feed only on dead organisms? Not all. This fungus is a lichen, providing nutrients to the tree. The lichen gets sugars from the plant. Both benefit from this relationship. 
Symbiotic  Relationships of  Fungi 	  Not all fungi feed on dead organisms. Many are involved in symbiotic relationships, including parasitism and mutualism. 
Fungi as  Parasites 	  In a parasitic relationship, the parasite benefits while the host is harmed. Parasitic fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from them. Fungi have special structures for penetrating a host. They also produce enzymes that break down the host’s tissues. Parasitic fungi often cause illness and may eventually kill their host. They are the major cause of disease in agricultural plants. Fungi also parasitize animals, such as the insect pictured in Figure 8.21. Fungi even parasitize humans. Did you ever have athelete’s foot? If so, you were the host of a parasitic fungus. 
Parasitic  Fungus and  Insect  Host.  The 	  white parasitic fungus named Cordyceps is shown here growing on its host—a dark brown moth. 
Mutualism in  Fungi 	  Fungi have several mutualistic relationships with other organisms. In mutualism, both organisms benefit from the relationship. Two common mutualistic relationships involving fungi are mycorrhiza and lichen. • A mycorrhiza is a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a plant. The fungus grows in or on the plant roots. The fungus benefits from the easy access to food made by the plant. The plant benefits because the fungus puts out mycelia that help absorb water and nutrients. Scientists think that a symbiotic relationship such as this may have allowed plants to first colonize the land. • A lichen is an organism that results from a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic organism. The other organism is usually a cyanobacterium or green alga. The fungus grows around the bacterial or algal cells. The fungus benefits from the constant supply of food produced by the photosynthesizer. The photosynthesizer benefits from the water and nutrients absorbed by the fungus. Figure 8.22 shows lichen growing on a rock. Some fungi have mutualistic relationships with insects. For example: • Leafcutter ants grow fungi on beds of leaves in their nests. The fungi get a protected place to live. The ants feed the fungi to their larvae. • Ambrosia beetles bore holes in tree bark and “plant” fungal spores in the holes. The holes in the bark give the fungi an ideal place to grow. The beetles harvest fungi from their “garden.” 
Summary 	  • Many fungi are involved in symbiotic relationships. • Some fungi are parasites. They are specialized to penetrate a host and break down the host’s tissues. Parasitic fungi often cause illness and may eventually kill their host. • Two common mutualistic relationships involving fungi are mycorrhiza (fungi and plant roots) and lichen (fungi and either cyanobacteria or green algae). • Some fungi also have mutualistic relationships with insects. Lichen Growing on Rock. Unlike plants, lichen can grow on bare rocks because they don’t have roots. That’s why lichens are often pioneer species in primary ecological succession.

What type of evidence might help you identify which is the correct relationship? • List human uses of fungi. What’s growing on this lemon? Would you believe penicillin? Penicillin is a mold, which of course is a fungus, one that has helped millions, if not billions, of people. 
Human  Uses of  Fungi 	  Whenever you eat pizza, you eat fungi, even if you don’t like your pizza with mushrooms. That’s because pizza dough contains yeast. Do you know other foods that are made with fungi? 
Fungi for  Food 	  Humans have collected and grown mushrooms for food for thousands of years. Figure 8.23 shows some of the many types of mushrooms that people eat. Yeasts are used in bread baking and brewing alcoholic beverages. Other fungi are used in fermenting a wide variety of foods, including soy sauce, tempeh, and cheeses. Blue cheese has its distinctive appearance and flavor because of the fungus growing though it (see Figure 8.24). 
Fungi for  Pest  Control 	  Harmless fungi can be used to control pathogenic bacteria and insect pests on crops. Fungi compete with bacteria for nutrients and space, and they parasitize insects that eat plants. Fungi reduce the need for pesticides and other toxic chemicals. 
These are just a few of the many species 	  of edible mushrooms consumed by humans. Blue Cheese. The dark blue strands running through this cheese are a fungus. In fact, this cheese is moldy! The fungus is Penicillium roqueforti, a type of mold. 
Other  Uses of  Fungi 	  Fungi are useful for many other reasons. • They are a major source of citric acid (vitamin C). • They produce antibiotics such as penicillin, which has saved countless lives. • They can be genetically engineered to produce insulin and other human hormones. • They are model research organisms. To see how one lab is using yeast in cancer research, watch the video, Yeast Unleashed, at this link: URL . 
Summary 	  • Humans use fungi for many purposes, including as food or in the preparation of food. • Humans also use fungi for pest control. • In addition, fungi can be used to produce citric acid, antibiotics, and human hormones. • Fungi are model research organisms as well.

Would you eat these mushrooms? I would not recommend it. But certain red mushrooms, Ganoderma Lucidum, have been found to be good for you. Red Mushrooms comprise a family of more than 200 mushroom species, which are good for our health. Of these, 6 species have a particularly high therapeutic effect. 
Fungi and  Human  Disease 	  Fungi cause human illness in three different ways: poisonings, parasitic infections, and allergic reactions. Science on the SPOT: Fungus Fair explores some of these dangerous but also tasty and weirdly wonderful fungi. See http ://science.kqed.org/quest/video/science-on-the-spot-fungus-fair/ for details. 
Fungal  Poisoning 	  Many fungi protect themselves from parasites and predators by producing toxic chemicals. If people eat toxic fungi, they may experience digestive problems, hallucinations, organ failure, and even death. Most cases of mushroom poisoning are due to mistaken identity. That’s because many toxic mushrooms look very similar to safe, edible mushrooms. An example is shown in Figure 8.25. 
Fungal  Parasites 	  Some fungi cause disease when they become human parasites. Two examples are fungi in the genera Candida and Trichophyton. Poisonous or Edible? The destroying angel mushroom on the left causes liver and kidney failure. The puffball mushroom on the right is tasty and harmless. Do you think you could tell these two species of mushrooms apart? • Candida are yeast that cause candidiasis, commonly called a “yeast infection.” The yeast can infect the mouth or the vagina. If yeast enter the blood, they cause a potentially life threatening illness. However, this is rare, except in people with a depressed immune system. • Trichophyton are fungi that cause ringworm. This is a skin infection characterized by a ring-shaped rash. The rash may occur on the arms, legs, head, neck, or trunk. The same fungi cause athlete’s foot when they infect the skin between the toes. Athlete’s foot is the second most common skin disease in the U.S. 
Fungal  Allergies 	  Mold allergies are very common. They are caused by airborne mold spores. When the spores enter the respiratory tract, the immune system responds to them as though they were harmful microbes. Symptoms may include sneezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. The symptoms are likely to be more severe in people with asthma or other respiratory diseases. Long-term exposure to mold spores may also weaken the immune system. Molds grow indoors as well as out. Indoors, they grow in showers, basements, and other damp places. Homes damaged in floods and hurricanes may have mold growing just about everywhere (see Figure 8.27). Indoor mold may cause more health problems than outdoor mold because of the closed, confined space. Most people also spend more time indoors than out. 
Summary 	  • Fungi cause three different types of human illness: poisonings, parasitic infections, and allergies. • Many poisonous mushrooms are eaten by mistake because they look like edible mushrooms. • Parasitic yeasts cause candidiasis, ringworm, and athlete’s foot. • Mold allergies are very common. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. Ringworm produces a ring-shaped rash, but it isn’t caused by a worm. It’s caused by the same fungus that causes athlete’s foot.

Summary 	  Protists and Fungi discusses these two types of eukaryotic organisms. What do they have in common? Protists are the earliest eukaryotes, and this kingdom contains some of the simplest eukaryotes. Many are single-celled organisms. Protists consist of animal-like, plant-like, and fungus-like species. Protists evolved into the other three types of eukaryotes, including fungi. Other than that, these two types of eukaryotes are very different. Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that cannot make their own food and do not "eat." They must absorb their nutrients, usually from decaying organisms. diatoms and multicellular seaweed are algae . Public Domain .

Introduction 	  What exactly is a plant? Does a plant have to be green? Do they all photosynthesize? Are there plants that can move from place to place? How do plants reproduce? These questions and more will be addressed in the Plants chapter. • Identify common traits of plants. • Explain how plants obtain food. What are Plants? Autumn. A time when leaves turn amazing colors. Of course, leaves are part of plants. But what are plants? What separates a plant from a fungus or protist? Or animal? 
Plants 	  Imagine that human life cycles resembled those of the earliest plants. If you think about this analogy, you may begin to realize that many plants, which appear so inert to our roving eyes and active minds, actually lead secret lives of surprising variety. You know that humans develop, or gradually change, from infants to quite different, sexually mature adults. You also know that meiosis in your own ovaries or testes produces haploid eggs or sperm, which must join in fertilization to become a new individual. Each of us, of course, began as that single cell made when a sperm united with an egg. Now, through mitosis and the miracle of development, we are made of trillions of cells organized into tissues, organs, and organ systems, which make us complex, amazing, active, individual beings. None of us would doubt that we have changed significantly since we began as single cells. Each of us has a unique identity that we keep throughout our entire lives, until death marks our end. We may give birth to other individuals by producing eggs or sperm, but only if they join with other sperm or eggs to produce new, separate lives. If, however, we lived like some plants, your father would not have produced the sperm cell destined to provide half of your genes, although there would be such a sperm cell. Your mother would not have produced the egg cell destined to produce the other half. In fact, your parents, and you, would not be distinguishable as male or female. Instead, both parents (or maybe just one parent) would have released thousands of haploid spore cells, each of which would grow, by mitosis, into a new individual being, entirely different in form and habitat from its parents and you. Small spores would become males, and large spores females, but as if sperm and egg had decided to postpone their “marriage” and grow up on their own, these beings would live very different, “non-human” lives. Who are these beings? You are certainly not one of them, because you begin only when egg meets sperm. Their differences from you would be far greater than the differences between tadpole and frog, or caterpillar and butterfly, because every individual butterfly or frog could (theoretically) identify exactly which individual caterpillar or tadpole it used to be. Not so with these haploid creatures. At some time during their relatively long lives, the male and female beings would produce sperm cells and egg cells by mitosis. Fertilization would not involve mating, of course. Depending on which kind of plant we chose as our model, sperm might swim on their own (with two or more flagella) from male to female being, or they might be blown by the wind, or carried by an animal. After sperm and egg join, you would begin your life as a single cell, and grow into an “adult,” eventually producing your own haploid spores. But you would never be able to identify your parents –if indeed you had two –nor would you know your children, because entire haploid lives would separate you. Why do plants lead such complex, multiple lives? Most of the plants you are probably familiar with produce flowers. However, plants existed for hundreds of millions of years before they evolved flowers. In fact, the earliest plants were different from most modern plants in several important ways. They not only lacked flowers, but also lacked leaves, roots, and stems. You might not even recognize them as plants. So why are the earliest plants placed in the plant kingdom? What traits define a plant? What are Plants? Plants are multicellular eukaryotic organisms with cell walls made of cellulose. Plant cells also have chloroplasts. In addition, plants have specialized reproductive organs. These are structures that produce reproductive cells. Male reproductive organs produce sperm, and female reproductive organs produce eggs. Male and female reproductive organs may be on the same or different plants. How Do Plants Obtain Food? Almost all plants make food by photosynthesis. Only about 1 percent of the estimated 300,000 species of plants have lost the ability to photosynthesize. These other species are consumers, many of them predators. How do plants prey on other organisms? The Venus fly trap in Figure 9.1 shows one way this occurs. What Do Plants Need? Plants need temperatures above freezing while they are actively growing and photosynthesizing. They also need sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water for photosynthesis. Like most other organisms, plants need oxygen for cellular respiration and minerals to build proteins and other organic molecules. Most plants support themselves above the ground with stiff stems in order to get light, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. Most plants also grow roots down into the soil to absorb water and minerals. And, of course, we need the energy stored in plants through photosynthesis to survive. Life as we know it would not be possible without plants.

What is so special about this particular plant? Look at this plant. You could say it has some interesting fruit. Some might say the fruit does not even look that tasty. However, this is a cacao tree, and its seeds are the source of chocolate. So, there are some people who would argue that this is one of the most important plants in the whole plant kingdom. 
The  Importance of  Plants 	  The importance of plants to humans and just about all other life on Earth is staggering. Life as we know it would not be possible without plants. Why are plants so important? • Plants supply food to nearly all terrestrial organisms, including humans. We eat either plants or other organisms that eat plants. • Plants maintain the atmosphere. They produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms. It also maintains the ozone layer that helps protect Earth’s life from damaging UV radiation. Removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere reduces the greenhouse effect and global warming. • Plants recycle matter in biogeochemical cycles. For example, through transpiration, plants move enormous amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere. Plants such as peas host bacteria that fix nitrogen. This makes nitrogen available to all plants, which pass it on to consumers. • Plants provide many products for human use, such as firewood, timber, fibers, medicines, dyes, pesticides, oils, and rubber. • Plants create habitats for many organisms. A single tree may provide food and shelter to many species of insects, worms, small mammals, birds, and reptiles (see Figure 9.2). 
Red-eyed tree frogs like this one live in 	  banana trees. We obviously can’t live without plants, but sometimes they cause us problems. Many plants are weeds. Weeds are plants that grow where people don’t want them, such as gardens and lawns. They take up space and use resources, hindering the growth of more desirable plants. People often introduce plants to new habitats where they lack natural predators and parasites. The introduced plants may spread rapidly and drive out native plants. Many plants produce pollen, which can cause allergies. Plants may also produce toxins that harm human health (see Figure 9.3). Poison ivy causes allergic skin rashes. It’s easy to recognize the plant by its arrangement of leaves in groups of three. That’s the origin of the old saying, “leaves of three, leave it be.” Why Study Plants? Members of the plant kingdom play many crucial and sometimes surprising roles in the drama of life on Earth. You are probably familiar with some reasons plants are important. Why should you understand how plants live? Because plants play many roles, including but certainly not limited to: More than 100,000 natural compounds come from plants, and most of these have yet to be explored. Some of the most powerful and useful compounds come from plants. Who knew they could help us unlock some of the biology’s mysteries all using an approach of mapping biological pathways.

Life  Cycle of  Plants 	  All plants have a characteristic life cycle that includes alternation of generations. Plants alternate between haploid and diploid generations. Alternation of generations allows for both asexual and sexual reproduction. Beginning with the diploid sporophyte, spores form from meiosis. Asexual reproduction with spores produces haploid individuals called gametophytes, which produce haploid gametes by mitosis. Sexual reproduction with gametes and fertilization produces the diploid sporophyte. A typical plant’s life cycle is diagrammed in Figure 9.4. Early plants reproduced mainly with spores and spent most of their life cycle as haploid gametophytes. Spores require little energy and matter to produce, and they grow into new individuals without the need for fertilization. In contrast, most modern plants reproduce with gametes using pollen and seeds, and they spend most of their life cycle as diploid sporophytes. Many modern plants can also reproduce asexually using roots, stems, or leaves. This is called vegetative reproduction. One way this can occur is shown in Figure 9.5. 
Life  Cycle of  Plants.  This diagram shows 	  the general life cycle of a plant. Strawberry plants have horizontal stems called stolons that run over the ground surface. If they take root, they form new plants.

Which moved onto land first, plants or animals? This fossilized fern may be millions of years old. Over 200 million years ago, the first evidence of ferns related to several modern families appeared. The "great fern radiation" occurred in the late-Cretaceous, which ended 65 million years ago, when many modern families of ferns first appeared. And if animals were the first on land, would many have starved? 
Evolution of  Plants 	  As shown in Figure 9.6, plants are thought to have evolved from an aquatic green alga protist. Later, they evolved important adaptations for land, including vascular tissues, seeds, and flowers. Each of these major adaptations made plants better suited for life on dry land and much more successful. 
The  Earliest  Plants 	  The earliest plants were probably similar to the stonewort, an aquatic algae pictured in Figure 9.7. Unlike most modern plants, stoneworts have stalks rather than stiff stems, and they have hair-like structures called rhizoids 
From a simple, green alga ancestor 	  that lived in the water, plants eventually evolved several major adaptations for life on land. instead of roots. On the other hand, stoneworts have distinct male and female reproductive structures, which is a plant characteristic. For fertilization to occur, sperm need at least a thin film of moisture to swim to eggs. In all these ways, the first plants may have resembled stoneworts. 
Modern stoneworts may be similar to the 	  earliest plants. Shown is a field of modern stoneworts (right), and an example from the Charophyta, a division of green algae that includes the closest relatives of the earliest plants (left). 
Life on  Land 	  By the time the earliest plants evolved, animals were already the dominant organisms in the ocean. Plants were also constrained to the upper layer of water that received enough sunlight for photosynthesis. Therefore, plants never became dominant marine organisms. But when plants moved onto land, everything was wide open. Why was the land devoid of other life? Without plants growing on land, there was nothing for other organisms to feed on. Land could not be colonized by other organisms until land plants became established. Plants may have colonized the land as early as 700 million years ago. The oldest fossils of land plants date back about 470 million years. The first land plants probably resembled modern plants called liverworts, like the one shown in Figure 9.8. Colonization of the land was a huge step in plant evolution. Until then, virtually all life had evolved in the ocean. Dry land was a very different kind of place. The biggest problem was the dryness. Simply absorbing enough water to stay alive was a huge challenge. It kept early plants small and low to the ground. Water was also needed for sexual The first land plants may have been similar to liverworts like this one. reproduction, so sperm could swim to eggs. In addition, temperatures on land were extreme and always changing. Sunlight was also strong and dangerous. It put land organisms at high risk of mutations. 
Vascular  Plants  Evolve 	  Plants evolved a number of adaptations that helped them cope with these problems on dry land. One of the earliest and most important was the evolution of vascular tissues. Vascular tissues form a plant’s “plumbing system.” They carry water and minerals from soil to leaves for photosynthesis. They also carry food (sugar dissolved in water) from photosynthetic cells to other cells in the plant for growth or storage. The evolution of vascular tissues revolutionized the plant kingdom. The tissues allowed plants to grow large and endure periods of drought in harsh land environments. Early vascular plants probably resembled the fern shown in Figure 9.9. 
Early vascular plants may have looked 	  like this modern fern. In addition to vascular tissues, these early plants evolved other adaptations to life on land, including lignin, leaves, roots, and a change in their life cycle. • Lignin is a tough carbohydrate molecule that is hydrophobic (“water fearing”). It adds support to vascular tissues in stems. It also waterproofs the tissues so they don’t leak, which makes them more efficient at transporting fluids. Because most other organisms cannot break down lignin, it helps protect plants from herbivores and parasites. • Leaves are rich in chloroplasts that function as solar collectors and food factories. The first leaves were very small, but leaves became larger over time. • Roots are vascular organs that can penetrate soil and even rock. They absorb water and minerals from soil and carry them to leaves. They also anchor a plant in the soil. Roots evolved from rhizoids, which nonvascular plants had used for absorption. • Land plants evolved a dominant diploid sporophyte generation. This was adaptive because diploid individuals are less likely to suffer harmful effects of mutations. They have two copies of each gene, so if a mutation occurs in one gene, they have a backup copy. This is extremely important on land, where there’s a lot of solar radiation. With all these advantages, it’s easy to see why vascular plants spread quickly and widely on land. Many nonvascular plants went extinct as vascular plants became more numerous. Vascular plants are now the dominant land plants on Earth. 
Summary 	  • The earliest plants are thought to have evolved in the ocean from a green alga ancestor. • Plants were among the earliest organisms to leave the water and colonize land. • The evolution of vascular tissues allowed plants to grow larger and thrive on land. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Plant Evolution at URL . • Outline major events in plant evolution. • Describe the importance of the seed. • Explain the relationship between ovules, pollen, pollen tubes, and pollination. • Distinguish between gymnosperms and angiosperms. Why are they called sunflowers? When the plant is in the bud stage, the flower tends to track the movement of the sun across the horizon, hence the name sunflower. Flowering plants were the last group of plants to evolve. The flower contains both the male and female reproductive structures, and these plants have become tremendously successful. But these plants could not have evolved without the prior evolution of the seed. So what exactly is a seed? 
Seed  Plants  Emerge 	  For reproduction, early vascular plants still needed moisture. Sperm had to swim from male to female reproductive organs for fertilization. Spores also needed some water to grow and often to disperse as well. Of course, dryness and other harsh conditions made it very difficult for tiny new offspring plants to survive. With the evolution of seeds in vascular plants, all that changed. Seed plants evolved a number of adaptations that made it possible to reproduce without water. As a result, seed plants were wildly successful. They exploded into virtually all of Earth’s habitats. Why are seeds so adaptive on land? A seed contains an embryo and a food supply enclosed within a tough coating. An embryo is a zygote that has already started to develop and grow. Early growth and development of a plant embryo in a seed is called germination. The seed protects and nourishes the embryo and gives it a huge head start in the “race” of life. Many seeds can wait to germinate until conditions are favorable for growth. This increases the offspring’s chance of surviving even more. Other reproductive adaptations that evolved in seed plants include ovules, pollen, pollen tubes, and pollination by animals. • An ovule is a female reproductive structure in seed plants that contains a tiny female gametophyte. The gametophyte produces an egg cell. After the egg is fertilized by sperm, the ovule develops into a seed. • A grain of pollen is a tiny male gametophyte enclosed in a tough capsule (see Figure 9.10). It carries sperm to an ovule while preventing it from drying out. Pollen grains can’t swim, but they are very light, so the wind can carry them. Therefore, they can travel through air instead of water. • Wind-blown pollen might land anywhere and be wasted. Another adaptation solved this problem. Plants evolved traits that attract specific animal pollinators. Like the bee in Figure 9.10, a pollinator picks up pollen on its body and carries it directly to another plant of the same species. This greatly increases the chance that fertilization will occur. • Pollen also evolved the ability to grow a tube, called a pollen tube, through which sperm could be transferred directly from the pollen grain to the egg. This allowed sperm to reach an egg without swimming through a film of water. It finally freed up plants from depending on moisture to reproduce. Individual grains of pollen may have prickly surfaces that help them stick to pollinators such as bees. What other animals pollinate plants? 
Seed  Plants  Diverge 	  The first seed plants formed seeds in cones. Cones are made up of overlapping scales, which are modified leaves (see Figure 9.11). Male cones contain pollen, and female cones contain eggs. Seeds also develop in female cones. Modern seed plants that produce seeds in cones are called gymnosperms. Later, seed plants called angiosperms evolved. They produce flowers, which consist of both male and female reproductive structures. The female reproductive structure in a flower includes an organ called an ovary. Eggs form 
Gymnosperms produce seeds in cones 	  (left). Each scale has a seed attached (right). in ovules inside ovaries, which also enclose and protect developing seeds after fertilization occurs. In many species of flowering plants, ovaries develop into fruits, which attract animals that disperse the seeds.

Classification of  Plants 	  The scientific classification of modern land plants is under constant revision. Informally, land plants can be classified into the groups listed in Table 9.1. Major divisions and types of modern land plants are organized in this table. Why do the first five types of plants require a moist habitat? The most basic division is between nonvascular plants and vascular plants. Vascular plants are further divided into those that reproduce without seeds and those that reproduce with seeds. Seed plants, in turn, are divided into those that produce seeds in cones and those that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers. Seed plants are called gymnosperms. Seed plants called angiosperms produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers.

Summary 	  • The most basic division of living plants is between nonvascular and vascular plants. • Vascular plants are further divided into seedless and seed plants. • Seed plants called gymnosperms produce seeds in cones. • Seed plants called angiosperms produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers.

Do all plants have roots? The massive moss covering these branches seems to be dominating its habitat. And maybe it is. Mosses, being nonvascular plants, don’t need roots to grow, so they can easily cover moist areas. Mosses commonly grow close together in clumps or mats in damp or shady locations. You may even have mats of moss growing in your backyard. 
Nonvascular  Plants 	  Nonvascular plants are bryophytes. Despite the dominance of vascular plants today, more than 17,000 species of bryophytes still survive. They include liverworts, hornworts, and mosses. 
Characteristics of  Nonvascular  Plants 	  Most bryophytes are small. They not only lack vascular tissues; they also lack true leaves, seeds, and flowers. Instead of roots, they have hair-like rhizoids to anchor them to the ground and to absorb water and minerals (see Figure absorbing water. Bryophytes also depend on moisture to reproduce. Sperm produced by a male gametophyte must swim through a layer of rainwater or dew to reach an egg produced by a female gametophyte. The tiny, diploid sporophyte generation then undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores. The spores may also need moisture to disperse. 
The rhizoids of a bryophyte may be so fine 	  that they are just one cell thick. 
Evolution of  Nonvascular  Plants 	  Nonvascular plants were the first plants to evolve. Compared to other plants, their small size and lack of specialized structures, such as vascular tissue, stems, leaves, or flowers, explains why these plants evolved first. The first nonvascular plants to evolve were the liverworts. The hornworts evolved somewhat later, and mosses apparently evolved last. Of all the bryophytes, mosses are most similar to vascular plants. Presumably, they share the most recent common ancestor with vascular plants. 
Diversity of  Nonvascular  Plants 	  The three types of modern nonvascular plants are pictured in Figure 9.13. • Liverworts are tiny nonvascular plants that have leaf-like, lobed, or ribbon-like photosynthetic tissues rather than leaves. Their rhizoids are very fine, they lack stems, and they are generally less than 10 centimeters (4 inches) tall. They often grow in colonies that carpet the ground. • Hornworts are minute nonvascular plants, similar in size to liverworts. They also have very fine rhizoids and lack stems. Their sporophytes are long and pointed, like tiny horns. They rise several centimeters above the gametophytes of the plant. • Mosses are larger nonvascular plants that have coarser, multicellular rhizoids that are more like roots. They also have tiny, photosynthetic structures similar to leaves that encircle a central stem-like structure. Mosses grow in dense clumps, which help them retain moisture. 
Summary 	  • Nonvascular plants are called bryophytes. • Nonvascular plants include liverworts, hornworts, and mosses. They lack roots, stems, and leaves. • Nonvascular plants are low-growing, reproduce with spores, and need a moist habitat. Liverworts, hornworts, and mosses are modern bryophytes. Liverworts are named for the liver-shaped leaves of some species. Hornworts are named for their horn-like sporophytes. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Non-vascular at URL . • Define tracheophyte. • Give an overview of seedless vascular plants. • Compare xylem to phloem. • Explain the functions of roots, stems, and leaves. How does water move from the roots to the top of these trees? Redwood trees found in Yosemite National Park in California. Big? Of course. How do these trees grow so tall? It has a lot to do with a very efficient system to move water, sugars and other nutrients. But the first plants to have such a "vascular system" were not tall trees, but much smaller plants. 
Vascular  Plants 	  Vascular plants are known as tracheophytes, which literally means “tube plants.” The earliest vascular plants quickly came to dominate terrestrial ecosystems. Why were they so successful? It was mainly because of their tube-like vascular tissues. 
Vascular  Tissues 	  The vascular tissues for which these plants are named are specialized to transport fluid. They consist of long, narrow cells arranged end-to-end, forming tubes. There are two different types of vascular tissues, called xylem and phloem. Both are shown in Figure 9.14. • Xylem is vascular tissue that transports water and dissolved minerals from roots to stems and leaves. This type of tissue consists of dead cells that lack end walls between adjacent cells. The side walls are thick and reinforced with lignin, which makes them stiff and water proof. • Phloem is vascular tissue that transports food (sugar dissolved in water) from photosynthetic cells to other parts of the plant for growth or storage. This type of tissue consists of living cells that are separated by end walls with tiny perforations, or holes. 
Xylem and phloem are the two types of 	  vascular tissues in vascular plants. 
Evolution of  Vascular  Plants 	  The first vascular plants evolved about 420 million years ago. They probably evolved from moss-like bryophyte ancestors, but they had a life cycle dominated by the diploid sporophyte generation. As they continued to evolve, early vascular plants became more plant-like in other ways as well. • Vascular plants evolved true roots made of vascular tissues. Compared with rhizoids, roots can absorb more water and minerals from the soil. They also anchor plants securely in the ground, so plants can grow larger without toppling over. • Vascular plants evolved stems made of vascular tissues and lignin. Because of lignin, stems are stiff, so plants can grow high above the ground where they can get more light and air. Because of their vascular tissues, stems keep even tall plants supplied with water so they don’t dry out in the air. • Vascular plants evolved leaves to collect sunlight. At first, leaves were tiny and needle-like, which helped reduce water loss. Later, leaves were much larger and broader, so plants could collect more light. With their vascular tissues and other adaptations, early vascular plants had the edge over nonvascular plants. The could grow tall and take advantage of sunlight high up in the air. Bryophytes were the photosynthetic pioneers onto land, but early vascular plants were the photosynthetic pioneers into air. 
Diversity of  Seedless  Vascular  Plants 	  Surviving descendants of early vascular plants include clubmosses and ferns. There are 1,200 species of clubmoss and more than 20,000 species of fern. Both types of vascular plants are seedless and reproduce with spores. Two examples are pictured in Figures 9.15 and 9.16. • Clubmosses look like mosses and grow low to the ground. Unlike mosses, they have roots, stems, and leaves, although the leaves are very small. • Ferns look more like “typical” plants. They have large leaves and may grow very tall. Some even develop into trees. Clubmosses like these are often confused with mosses. 
Summary 	  • Vascular plants are known as tracheophytes. • Vascular tissues include xylem and phloem. They allow plants to grow tall in the air without drying out. • Vascular plants also have roots, stems, and leaves. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • What Are The Four Types Of Vascular Plants? at URL r-Types-Of-Vascular-Plants . There’s no confusing ferns with mosses. Why do these ferns look more plant-like? • Define spermatophyte. • Describe the parts of the seed, including the embryo, seed coat, and endosperm. • Outline the classification and evolution of seed plants. How old can a plant be? This is obviously a seed plant. It is a Gingko tree, which is an unique species in that there are no close living relatives. Gingkoes can live for a very long time. Some specimens of this species are thought to be over 2,500 years old. The Ginkgo is also known as a living fossil, with fossils related to modern Ginkgo from the Permian period, dating back 270 million years. 
Seed  Plants 	  Seed plants are called spermatophytes. The evolution of seeds by vascular plants was a very big deal. In fact, it was arguably as important as the evolution of vascular tissues. Seeds solved the problem of releasing offspring into a dry world. Once seeds evolved, vascular seed plants and their descendants diversified to fill terrestrial niches everywhere. Today, vascular seed plants dominate Earth. 
Parts of a  Seed 	  As shown in Figure 9.17, a seed consists of at least three basic parts: the embryo, seed coat, and stored food. • The embryo develops from a fertilized egg. While still inside the seed, the embryo forms its first leaf (cotyledon) and starts to develop a stem (hypocotyl) and root (radicle). • The tough seed coat protects the embryo and keeps it from drying out until conditions are favorable for germination. • The stored food in a seed is called endosperm. It nourishes the embryo until it can start making food on its own. A typical plant seed, like this avocado seed, contains an embryo, seed coat, and endosperm. How does each part contribute to the successful development of the new plant? Many seeds have additional structures that help them disperse. Some examples are shown in Figure 9.18. Structures may help them travel in the wind or stick to animals. Dispersal of seeds away from parent plants helps reduce competition with the parents and increases the chance of offspring surviving. Dandelion seeds have tiny “parachutes.” Maple seeds have “wings” that act like little gliders. Burdock seeds are covered with tiny hooks that cling to animal fur. 
Classification of  Seed  Plants 	  The two major types of seed plants are the gymnosperms (seeds in cones) and angiosperms (seeds in ovaries of flowers). Figure 9.19 shows how the seeds of gymnosperms and angiosperms differ. Do you see the main difference between the two seeds? The angiosperm seed is surrounded by an ovary. 
In gymnosperms, a seed develops on the 	  scale of a cone. Only an angiosperm seed develops inside an ovary. There are only about 1,000 living species of gymnosperms, whereas there are hundreds of thousands of living species of angiosperms. Living gymnosperms are typically classified in the divisions described in the Table 9.2. Most modern gymnosperms are trees with woody trunks. The majority are conifers such as pine trees. 
There is only one living species 	  (Ginkgo biloba); some living trees are more than 2000 years old; they originated in Asia but now are cultivated all over the world; they have been used for medicines for thousands of years. 
There are more than 700 living 	  species; most are trees such as pines with needle-like leaves; they are often the dominant plants in their habitats; they are valuable to humans for paper and timber. TABLE 9.2: (continued) 
Description 	  There are about 300 living species; they are typically trees with stout trunks and fern-like leaves; they live only in tropical and subtropical climates; they have large, brightlycolored seed cones to attract animal pollinators. 
There are fewer than 100 living 	  species; most are woody vines with evergreen leaves; they live mainly in tropical climates; they are the least well known gymnosperms but the most similar to angiosperms. 
Evolution of  Seed  Plants 	  The earliest seed plants probably evolved close to 300 million years ago. They were similar to modern ginkgoes and reproduced with pollen and seeds in cones. Early seed plants quickly came to dominate forests during the Mesozoic Era, or Age of the Dinosaurs, about 250 to 65 million years ago. As seed plants continued to evolve, Earth’s overall climate became drier, so early seed plants evolved adaptations to help them live with low levels of water. Some also evolved adaptations to cold. They had woody trunks and needle-like, evergreen leaves covered with a thick coating of waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Some of the trees were huge, like today’s giant sequoia, a modern conifer (see Figure 9.20). 
The person standing at the foot of this 	  giant sequoia show just how enormous the tree is. Some early seed plants also grew very large. Eventually, some gymnosperms started to evolve angiosperm-like traits. For example, cycad ancestors were the first plants to use insects as pollinators. They also used birds and monkeys to disperse their brightly colored seeds. Of modern gymnosperms, Gnetae probably share the most recent common ancestor with angiosperms. Among other similarities, Gnetae produce nectar, a sweet, sugary liquid that attracts insect pollinators. Most modern flowering plants also produce nectar. 
Summary 	  • Most vascular plants are seed plants, or spermatophytes. They reproduce with seeds and pollen. • Some modern seed plants are gymnosperms that produce seeds in cones. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Seed Bearing Plants at URL . • Describe the parts of a flower, including the stamen, pistil, petals, and sepals. • Summarize the adaptations and evolution of flowering plants. • Distinguish monocots from eudicots, and from magnolids. So what exactly is a flower? This closeup view of a lily flower shows the fine detail of this structure. Why are flowers so colorful? What is the purpose of all the parts? They were one of the last adaptations of the plant kingdom, suggesting immense evolutionary significance. 
Flowering  Plants 	  Angiosperms, or flowering seed plants, form seeds in ovaries. As the seeds develop, the ovaries may develop into fruits. Flowers attract pollinators, and fruits encourage animals to disperse the seeds. 
Parts of a  Flower 	  A flower consists of male and female reproductive structures. The main parts of a flower are shown in Figure 9.21. They include the stamen, pistil, petals, and sepals. • The stamen is the male reproductive structure of a flower. It consists of a stalk-like filament that ends in an anther. The anther contains pollen sacs, in which meiosis occurs and pollen grains form. The filament raises the anther up high so its pollen will be more likely to blow in the wind or be picked up by an animal pollinator. • The pistil is the female reproductive structure of a flower. It consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. The stigma is raised and sticky to help it catch pollen. The style supports the stigma and connects it to the ovary, which contains the egg. Petals attract pollinators to the flower. Petals are often brightly colored so pollinators will notice them. • Sepals protect the developing flower while it is still a bud. Sepals are usually green, which camouflages the bud from possible consumers. 
A flower includes both male and female 	  reproductive structures. 
Flowers and  Pollinators 	  Many flowers have bright colors, strong scents, and sweet nectar to attract animal pollinators. They may attract insects, birds, mammals, and even reptiles. While visiting a flower, a pollinator picks up pollen from the anthers. When the pollinator visits the next flower, some of the pollen brushes off on the stigma. This allows cross-pollination, which increases genetic diversity. See The beauty of pollination at URL for an amazing look at this process. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Other  Characteristics of  Flowering  Plants 	  Although flowers and their components are the major innovations of angiosperms, they are not the only ones. Angiosperms also have more efficient vascular tissues. Additionally, in many flowering plants the ovaries ripen into fruits. Fruits are often brightly colored, so animals are likely to see and eat them and disperse their seeds (see 
Brightly colored fruits attract animals that 	  may disperse their seeds. It’s hard to miss the bright red apples on these trees. 
Evolution of  Flowering  Plants 	  Flowering plants are thought to have evolved at least 200 million years ago from gymnosperms like Gnetae. The earliest known fossils of flowering plants are about 125 million years old. The fossil flowers have male and female reproductive organs but no petals or sepals. Scientists think that the earliest flowers attracted insects and other animals, which spread pollen from flower to flower. This greatly increased the efficiency of fertilization over wind-spread pollen, which might or might not actually land on another flower. To take better advantage of this “animal labor,” plants evolved traits such as brightly colored petals to attract pollinators. In exchange for pollination, flowers gave the pollinators nectar. Giving free nectar to any animal that happened to come along was not an efficient use of resources. Much of the pollen might be carried to flowers of different species and therefore wasted. As a result, many plants evolved ways to “hide” their nectar from all but very specific pollinators, which would be more likely to visit only flowers of the same species. For their part, animal pollinators co-evolved traits that allowed them to get to the hidden nectar. Two examples of this type of co-evolution are shown in Figure 9.23. Some of the most recent angiosperms to evolve are grasses. Humans started domesticating grasses such as wheat about 10,000 years ago. Why grasses? They have many large, edible seeds that contain a lot of nutritious stored food. They are also relatively easy to harvest. Since then, humans have helped shaped the evolution of grasses, as illustrated by the example in Figure 9.24. Grasses supply most of the food consumed by people worldwide. What other grass seeds do you eat? The hummingbird has a long narrow bill to reach nectar at the bottom of the tube-shaped flowers. The bat is active at night, so bright white, night-blooming flowers attract it. In each case, the flowering plant and its pollinator co-evolved to become better suited for their roles in the symbiotic relationship. The plant on the left, called teosinte, is the ancestor of modern, domesticated corn, shown on the right. An intermediate stage is pictured in the middle. How were humans able to change the plant so dramatically? 
Classification of  Flowering  Plants 	  There are more than a quarter million species of flowering plants, and they show tremendous diversity. Nonetheless, almost all flowering plants fall into one of three major groups: monocots, eudicots, or magnolids. The three groups differ in several ways. For example, monocot embryos form just one cotyledon, whereas eudicot and magnolid embryos form two cotyledons. The arrangement of their vascular tissues is also different. Examples of the three groups of flowering plants are given in Table 9.3. 
Monocots 	  TABLE 9.3: (continued)

Both traits aid the dispersal of seeds. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Flowering Plants at URL . • Describe plant cell structures, and list types of plant cells. • Explain the roles of the central vacuole, cell wall, and chloroplast. Why do plant cells look like little rectangles? A section of a pine embryo. Notice how all the cells seem to stack on each other, with no spaces in between. MIght this allow the cells to form structures that can grow upright? Organs in Plants? Your body includes organ systems, such as the digestive system, made of individual organs, such as the stomach, liver, and pancreas, which work together to carry out a certain function (in this case, breaking down and absorbing food). These organs, in turn, are made of different kinds of tissues, which are groups of cells which work together to perform a specific job. For example, your stomach is made of muscle tissue to facilitate movement and glandular tissue to secrete enzymes for chemical breakdown of food molecules. These tissues, in turn, are made of cells specialized in shape, size, and component organelles, such as mitochondria for energy and microtubules for movement. Plants, too, are made of organs, which in turn are made of tissues. Plant tissues, like ours, are constructed of specialized cells, which in turn contain specific organelles. It is these cells, tissues, and organs that carry out the dramatic lives of plants. 
Plant  Cells 	  Plant cells resemble other eukaryotic cells in many ways. For example, they are enclosed by a plasma membrane and have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. A typical plant cell is represented by the diagram in Figure Plant cells have all the same structures as animal cells, plus some additional structures. Can you identify the unique plant structures in the diagram? 
Plant  Cell  Structures 	  Structures found in plant cells but not animal cells include a large central vacuole, cell wall, and plastids such as chloroplasts. • The large central vacuole is surrounded by its own membrane and contains water and dissolved substances. Its primary role is to maintain pressure against the inside of the cell wall, giving the cell shape and helping to support the plant. • The cell wall is located outside the cell membrane. 
It consists mainly of cellulose and may also contain 	  lignin, which makes it more rigid. The cell wall shapes, supports, and protects the cell. It prevents the cell from absorbing too much water and bursting. It also keeps large, damaging molecules out of the cell. • Plastids are membrane-bound organelles with their own DNA. Examples are chloroplasts and chromoplasts. Chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll and carry out photosynthesis. Chromoplasts make and store other pigments. They give flower petals their bright colors. 
Types of  Plant  Cells 	  There are three basic types of cells in most plants. These cells make up ground tissue, which will be discussed in another concept. The three types of cells are described in Table 9.4. The different types of plant cells have different structures and functions. See Vascular Plant Tissues at URL for additional information.

It is actually the center portion of a carrot taproot. And these are all cells. Cells that have come together to form a tissue, with a specific function. What do you think is the main function of tissue in a plant’s root? 
Plant  Tissues 	  As for all animals, your body is made of four types of tissue: epidermal, muscle, nerve, and connective tissues. Plants, too, are built of tissues, but not surprisingly, their very different lifestyles derive from different kinds of tissues. All three types of plant cells are found in most plant tissues. Three major types of plant tissues are dermal, ground, and vascular tissues. 
Dermal  Tissue 	  Dermal tissue covers the outside of a plant in a single layer of cells called the epidermis. You can think of the epidermis as the plant’s skin. It mediates most of the interactions between a plant and its environment. Epidermal cells secrete a waxy substance called cuticle, which coats, waterproofs, and protects the above-ground parts of plants. Cuticle helps prevent water loss, abrasions, infections, and damage from toxins. This tissue includes several types of specialized cells. Pavement cells, large, irregularly shaped parenchymal cells which lack chloroplasts, make up the majority of the epidermis. Within the epidermis, thousands of pairs of beanshaped schlerenchymal guard cells swell and shrink by osmosis to open and close stomata, tiny pores which control the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases and the release of water vapor. The lower surfaces of some leaves contain as many as 100,000 stomata per square centimeter. 
The epidermis of  Arabidopsis shows both 	  pavement cells (A) and stomata made of sclerenchymal guard cells (B), which control water loss and gas exchange. 
Ground  Tissue 	  Ground tissue makes up much of the interior of a plant and carries out basic metabolic functions. Ground tissue in stems provides support and may store food or water. Ground tissues in roots may also store food. 
Vascular  Tissue 	  Vascular tissue runs through the ground tissue inside a plant. Your body was able to grow from a single cell to perhaps 100 trillion cells because, 21 days after fertilization, a tiny heart began to pump blood throughout your tiny self –and it hasn’t stopped since. The blood it pumps carries water, oxygen and nutrients to each one of your trillions of cells, and removes CO2 and other wastes. Of course plants don’t have hearts, but they do have vessels that transport water, minerals, and nutrients through the plant. These vessels are the vascular tissue, and consist of xylem and phloem. Xylem and phloem are packaged together in bundles, as shown in Figure 9.27. 
Summary 	  • The three types of plant cells are found in each of the major types of plant tissues: dermal, ground, and vascular tissues. • Dermal tissue covers the outside of a plant in a single layer of cells called the epidermis. It mediates most of the interactions between a plant and its environment. • Ground tissue makes up most of the interior of a plant. It carries out basic metabolic functions and stores food and water. • Vascular tissue runs through the ground tissue inside a plant. It consists of bundles of xylem and phloem, which transport fluids throughout the plant.

So how do plants grow? There must be an area of growth, similar to how the bones in your fingers, arms, and legs grow longer. There is, and it is called the apical meristem, which is shown here. 
Growth of  Plants 	  Most plants continue to grow throughout their lives. Like other multicellular organisms, plants grow through a combination of cell growth and cell division. Cell growth increases cell size, while cell division (mitosis) increases the number of cells. As plant cells grow, they also become specialized into different cell types through cellular differentiation. Once cells differentiate, they can no longer divide. How do plants grow or replace damaged cells after that? The key to continued growth and repair of plant cells is meristem. Meristem is a type of plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide and differentiate. Apical meristems are found at the apex, or tip, of roots and buds, allowing roots and stems to grow in length and leaves and flowers to differentiate. Roots and stems grow in length because the meristem adds tissue “behind” it, constantly propelling itself further into the ground (for roots) or air (for stems). Often, the apical meristem of a single branch will become dominant, suppressing the growth of meristems on other branches and leading to the development of a single trunk. In grasses, meristems at the base of the leaf blades allow for regrowth after grazing by herbivores –or mowing by lawnmowers. 
Microphotograph of the root tip of a broad 	  bean show rapidly dividing apical meristem tissue just behind the root cap. Numerous cells in various stages of mitosis can be observed. Apical meristems differentiate into the three basic types of meristem tissue which correspond to the three types of tissue: protoderm produces new epidermis, ground meristem produces ground tissue, and procambium produces new xylem and phloem. These three types of meristem are considered primary meristem because they allow growth in length or height, which is known as primary growth. Secondary meristems allow growth in diameter (secondary growth) in woody plants. Herbaceous plants do not have secondary growth. The two types of secondary meristem are both named cambium, meaning “exchange” or “change”. Vascular cambium produces secondary xylem (toward the center of the stem or root) and phloem (toward the outside of the stem or root), adding growth to the diameter of the plant. This process produces wood, and builds the sturdy trunks of trees. Cork cambium lies between the epidermis and the phloem, and replaces the epidermis of roots and stems with bark, one layer of which is cork. See URL for a time-lapse video of plant growth.

They grow through a combination of cell growth and cell division (mitosis). • The key to plant growth is meristem, a type of plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide and differentiate. • Meristem allows plant stems and roots to grow longer (primary growth) and wider (secondary growth).

Woody plants grow in two ways.  Primary 	  growth adds length or height, mediated by apical meristem tissue at the tips of roots and shoots –which is difficult to show clearly in cross-sectional diagrams. Secondary growth adds to the diameter of a stem or root; vascular cambium adds xylem (inward) and phloem (outward), and cork cambium replaces epidermis with bark. • Outline the structure, function, and growth of roots. • Distinguish between primary roots and secondary roots. • Explain the two basic types of root systems in plants. • Describe the role of the root cap. • Summarize the roles of roots. Now those are some serious roots. But what exactly are roots? There are taproots and fibrous roots, primary roots and secondary roots. And they always seem to know which way to grow. Roots are very special plant organs. How and why? 
Roots 	  Plants have specialized organs that help them survive and reproduce in a great diversity of habitats. Major organs of most plants include roots, stems, and leaves. Roots are important organs in all vascular plants. Most vascular plants have two types of roots: primary roots that grow downward and secondary roots that branch out to the side. Together, all the roots of a plant make up a root system. 
Root  Systems 	  There are two basic types of root systems in plants: taproot systems and fibrous root systems. Both are illustrated in • Taproot systems feature a single, thick primary root, called the taproot, with smaller secondary roots growing out from the sides. The taproot may penetrate as many as 60 meters (almost 200 feet) below the ground surface. It can plumb very deep water sources and store a lot of food to help the plant survive drought and other environmental extremes. The taproot also anchors the plant very securely in the ground. • Fibrous root systems have many small branching roots, called fibrous roots, but no large primary root. The huge number of threadlike roots increases the surface area for absorption of water and minerals, but fibrous roots anchor the plant less securely. 
Dandelions 	  grasses have fibrous root systems. taproot have systems; 
Root  Structures and  Functions 	  As shown in Figure 9.31, the tip of a root is called the root cap. It consists of specialized cells that help regulate primary growth of the root at the tip. Above the root cap is primary meristem, where growth in length occurs. Above the meristem, the rest of the root is covered with a single layer of epidermal cells. These cells may have root hairs that increase the surface area for the absorption of water and minerals from the soil. Beneath the epidermis is ground tissue, which may be filled with stored starch. Bundles of vascular tissues form the center of the root. Waxy layers waterproof the vascular tissues so they don’t leak, making them more efficient at carrying fluids. Secondary meristem is located within and around the vascular tissues. This is where growth in thickness occurs. The structure of roots helps them perform their primary functions. What do roots do? They have three major jobs: absorbing water and minerals, anchoring and supporting the plant, and storing food. dissolved minerals from the soil. The roots of many plants also have a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi for greater absorption. tall without toppling over. A tough covering may replace the epidermis in older roots, making them ropelike and even stronger. As shown in Figure 9.32, some roots have unusual specializations for anchoring plants. The bloodroot shown in Figure 9.32 stores food in its roots over the winter. 
Root  Growth 	  Roots have primary and secondary meristems for growth in length and width. As roots grow longer, they always grow down into the ground. Even if you turn a plant upside down, its roots will try to grow downward. How do 
A root is a complex organ consisting of 	  several types of tissue. What is the function of each tissue type? roots “know” which way to grow? How can they tell down from up? Specialized cells in root caps are able to detect gravity. The cells direct meristem in the tips of roots to grow downward toward the center of Earth. This is generally adaptive for land plants. Can you explain why? As roots grow thicker, they can’t absorb water and minerals as well. However, they may be even better at transporting fluids, anchoring the plant, and storing food (see Figure 9.33). 
Summary 	  • Roots absorb water and minerals and transport them to stems. They also anchor and support a plant, and store food. • A root system consists of primary and secondary roots. • Each root is made of dermal, ground, and vascular tissues. • Roots grow in length and width from primary and secondary meristem. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • URL → Non-Majors Biology → Search: Plant Organs and Systems Mangrove roots are like stilts, allowing mangrove trees to rise high above the water. The trunk and leaves are above water even at high tide. A bloodroot plant uses food stored over the winter to grow flowers in the early spring. 
Secondary growth of sweet potato roots 	  provides more space to store food. 
Roots store sugar from photosynthesis 	  as starch. What other starchy roots do people eat? • Explain the roles of stems. • Describe the different types of stems. • Summarize stem structure and growth. How does water get up? How does sugar move down? What structures hold the plant upright? Are tree trunks also stems? Of course they are. Trees don’t start out big and tall they grow from small plants to large trees. And it is these stems that allow them to grow upright. So, obviously the stem is very important and has numerous functions. 
Stems 	  In vascular plants, stems are the organs that hold plants upright so they can get the sunlight and air they need. Stems also bear leaves, flowers, cones, and secondary stems. These structures grow at points called nodes (shown in Figure Another vital function of stems is transporting water and minerals from roots to leaves and carrying food from leaves to the rest of the plant. Without this connection between roots and leaves, plants could not survive high above ground in the air. In many plants, stems also store food or water during cold or dry seasons. 
Stem  Diversity 	  Stems show variation because many stems are specialized. Figure 9.35 shows examples of stem specialization. With specialized stems, plants can exploit a diversity of niches in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems. The stem of a vascular plant has nodes where leaves and other structures may grow. Stem specializations such as these let plants grow in many different habitats. 
Stem  Tissues and  Functions 	  Like roots, the stems of vascular plants are made of dermal, vascular, and ground tissues. • A single-celled layer of epidermis protects and waterproofs the stem and controls gas exchange. • In trees, some of the epidermal tissue is replaced by bark. Bark is a combination of tissues that provides a tough, woody external covering on the stems of trees. The inner part of bark is alive and growing; the outer part is dead and provides strength, support, and protection. • Ground tissue forms the interior of the stem. The large central vacuoles of ground tissue cells fill with water to support the plant. The cells may also store food. • Bundles of vascular tissue run through the ground tissue of a stem and transport fluids. Plants may vary in how these bundles are arranged. 
Stem  Growth 	  The stems of all vascular plants get longer through primary growth. This occurs in primary meristem at the tips and nodes of the stems. Most stems also grow in thickness through secondary growth. This occurs in secondary meristem, which is located in and around the vascular tissues. Secondary growth forms secondary vascular tissues and bark. In many trees, the yearly growth of new vascular tissues results in an annual growth ring like the one in 
The number of rings in this cross-section 	  of tree trunk show how many years the tree lived. What does each ring represent?

Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • URL → Non-Majors Biology → Search: Plant Organs and Systems • Describe the structure and function of leaves. • Distinguish between microphylls, fronds, and needles. • Define blade and petiole. • Summarize the different leaf arrangements. • Explain why there are seasonal changes in leaves. Could life exist without the leaf? A leaf looks so simple. But it is actually a very complex structure. And it may be one of the most important organs in all kingdoms. Life as we know it could not exist without leaves. Why? One word: photosynthesis. 
Leaves 	  Plants have specialized organs that help them survive and reproduce in a great diversity of habitats. Major organs of most plants include roots, stems, and leaves. Leaves are the keys not only to plant life but to all terrestrial life. The primary role of leaves is to collect sunlight and make food by photosynthesis. Despite the fundamental importance of the work they do, there is great diversity in the leaves of plants. However, given the diversity of habitats in which plants live, it’s not surprising that there is no single best way to collect solar energy for photosynthesis. 
Leaf  Variation 	  Leaves may vary in size, shape, and their arrangement on stems. Nonflowering vascular plants have three basic types of leaves: microphylls (“tiny leaves”), fronds, and needles. Figure 9.37 describes each type. Leaf variation in nonflowering plants reflects their evolutionary origins. Can you explain how? Flowering vascular plants also have diverse leaves. However, the leaves of all flowering plants have two basic parts in common: the blade and petiole. The blade of the leaf is the relatively wide, flat part of the leaf that gathers sunlight and undergoes photosynthesis. The petiole is the part that attaches the leaf to a stem of the plant. This occurs at a node. Flowering plant leaves vary in how the leaves are arranged on the stem and how the blade is divided. This is illustrated in Figure 9.38. Generally, the form and arrangement of leaves maximizes light exposure while conserving water, reducing wind resistance, or benefiting the plant in some other way in its particular habitat. • Leaves arranged in whorls encircle upright stems at intervals. They collect sunlight from all directions. • Leaves arranged in basal rosettes take advantage of warm temperatures near the ground. • Leaves arranged in alternate or opposing pairs collect light from above. They are typically found on plants with a single, upright stem. • The blades of simple leaves are not divided. This provides the maximum surface area for collecting sunlight. • The blades of compound leaves are divided into many smaller leaflets. This reduces wind resistance and water loss. 
Seasonal  Changes in  Leaves 	  Even if you don’t live in a place where leaves turn color in the fall, no doubt you’ve seen photos of their “fall colors” (see Figure 9.39). The leaves of many plants turn from green to other, glorious colors during autumn each year. The change is triggered by shorter days and cooler temperatures. Leaves respond to these environmental stimuli by producing less chlorophyll. This allows other leaf pigments—such as oranges and yellows—to be seen. After leaves turn color in the fall, they may all fall off the plant for the winter. Plants that shed their leaves seasonally each year are called deciduous plants. Shedding leaves is a strategy for reducing water loss during seasons of extreme dryness. On the downside, the plant must grow new leaves in the spring, and that takes a lot of energy and Leaf variation in flowering plants may include variations in the arrangement of leaves and the divisions of the blade. 
A deciduous tree goes through dramatic 	  seasonal changes each year. Can you identify the seasons in the photo? matter. Some plants may “bank” energy over the winter by storing food. That way, they are ready to grow new leaves as soon as spring arrives. Evergreen plants have a different strategy for adapting to seasonal dryness. They don’t waste energy and matter growing new leaves each year. Instead, they keep their leaves and stay green year-round. However, to reduce water loss, they have needle-like leaves with very thick cuticle. On the downside, needle-like leaves reduce the surface area for collecting sunlight. This is one reason that needles may be especially rich in chlorophyll, as you can see from the dark green pine needles in Figure 9.40. This is also an important adaptation for low levels of sunlight, allowing evergreens to live far from the equator. 
Summary 	  • The primary function of leaves is to collect sunlight and make food by photosynthesis. • In a deciduous plant, leaves seasonally turn color and fall off the plant. They are replaced with new leaves Compare the color of the evergreen needles and the deciduous leaf. Why is the darker color of the needles adaptive? later in the year. • An evergreen plant keeps its green leaves year-round. It may have needle-like leaves to reduce water loss. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • URL → Non-Majors Biology → Search: Plant Organs and Systems • Define photosynthesis. • Explain the role of the leaf in photosynthesis. • Distinguish between mesophyll, veins, and the epidermis. • Explain the significance of stomata and guard cells. Oxygen —the oxygen that we breath —is just a waste product of what reaction? Every split second that sunlight hits that leaf, photosynthesis is initiated, bringing energy into the ecosystem. It could be said that this is one of the most important if not the absolutely most important biochemical reactions. And it all starts with the leaf. 
Factories for  Photosynthesis 	  Photosynthesis is the process that uses energy from the sun, together with carbon dioxide and water, to make glucose and oxygen. The primary role of photosynthesis is to make the carbohydrate, suggesting that oxygen, which is released back into the atmosphere, is just a waste product. You can think of a single leaf as a photosynthesis factory. A factory has specialized machines to produce a product. It’s also connected to a transportation system that supplies it with raw materials and carries away the finished product. In all these ways, a leaf resembles a factory. The cross section of a leaf in Figure 9.41 lets you look inside a leaf “factory.” A leaf consists of several different kinds of specialized tissues that work together to make food by photosynthesis. The major tissues are mesophyll, veins, and epidermis. • Mesophyll makes up most of the leaf’s interior. This is where photosynthesis occurs. Mesophyll consists mainly of parenchymal cells with chloroplasts. There’s more to a leaf than meets the eye. 
Can you identify the functions of each of 	  the labeled structures in the diagram? • Veins are made primarily of xylem and phloem. They transport water and minerals to the cells of leaves and carry away dissolved sugar. • The epidermis of the leaf consists of a single layer of tightly-packed dermal cells. They secrete waxy cuticle to prevent evaporation of water from the leaf. The epidermis has tiny pores called stomata (singular, stoma) that control transpiration and gas exchange with the air. For photosynthesis, stomata must control the transpiration of water vapor and the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. Stomata are flanked by guard cells that swell or shrink by taking in or losing water through osmosis. When they do, they open or close the stomata (see Figure 9.42). 
For photosynthesis, stomata must control 	  the transpiration of water vapor and the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen.

But fertilization must occur in the life cycles of all plants, not just those with flowers. Does it always use the birds or the bees? 
General  Plant  Life  Cycle 	  The life cycle of all plants is complex because it is characterized by alternation of generations. Plants alternate between diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte generations, and between sexual and asexual reproduction. The ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually gives plants the flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Their complex life cycle allows for great variation. A general plant life cycle is represented by the diagram in sporangia) that undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores. A spore develops into a haploid gametophyte. The gametophyte has male or female reproductive organs that undergo mitosis to form haploid gametes (sperm or eggs). Fertilization of gametes produces a diploid zygote. The zygote grows and develops into a mature sporophyte, and the cycle repeats. One of the two generations of a plant’s life cycle is typically dominant to the other generation. Whether it’s the sporophyte or gametophyte generation, individuals in the dominant generation live longer and grow larger. They are the green, photosynthetic structures that you would recognize as a fern, tree, or other plant (see Figure 9.44). Individuals in the nondominant generation, in contrast, may be very small and rarely seen. They may live in or on the dominant plant. 
This diagram represents the life cycle that 	  generally characterizes plants. The dominant generation in nonvascular plants is the gametophyte; in vascular plants, it’s the sporophyte. Why is a dominant sporophyte generation an advantage on land?

Which would you say is dominant? That may depend on the plant. Start with moss. The typical nonvascular plant. But such a simple plant has a very interesting life cycle. Whereas most kinds of plants have two sets of chromosomes in their vegetative cells, mosses have only a single set of chromosomes. So, how does meiosis occur? 
Life  Cycle of  Nonvascular  Plants 	  Nonvascular plants include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. They are the only plants with a life cycle in which the gametophyte generation is dominant. Figure 9.45 shows the life cycle of moss. The familiar, green, photosynthetic moss plants are gametophytes. The sporophyte generation is very small and dependent on the gametophyte plant. The gametophytes of nonvascular plants have distinct male or female reproductive organs (see Figure 9.46). Male reproductive organs, called antheridia (singular, antheridium), produce motile sperm with two flagella. Female reproductive organs, called archegonia (singular, archegonium), produce eggs. In order for fertilization to occur, sperm must swim in a drop of water from an antheridium to an egg in an archegonium. If fertilization takes place, it results in a zygote that develops into a tiny sporophyte on the parent gametophyte plant. The sporophyte produces haploid spores, and these develop into the next generation of gametophyte plants. Then the cycle repeats. 
Like other bryophytes, moss plants spend 	  most of their life cycle as gametophytes. 
Find the sporophyte in the diagram.  Do 	  you see how it is growing on the gametophyte plant? 
The reproductive organs of bryophytes 	  like this liverwort are male antheridia and female archegonia.

Nearly all ferns have fiddleheads, and many recipes exist on how to prepare fiddleheads. But this part of the plant, the leaf or the frond, also plays a very important role in the fern’s life cycle. 
Life  Cycle of  Seedless  Vascular  Plants 	  Unlike nonvascular plants, all vascular plants—including seedless vascular plants—have a dominant sporophyte generation. Seedless vascular plants include clubmosses and ferns. Figure 9.47 shows a typical fern life cycle. A mature sporophyte fern has the familiar leafy fronds. The undersides of the leaves are dotted with clusters of sporangia. Sporangia produce spores that develop into tiny, heart-shaped gametophytes. Gametophytes have antheridia and archegonia. Antheridia produce sperm with many cilia; archegonia produce eggs. Fertilization occurs when sperm swim to an egg inside an archegonium. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo that becomes a new sporophyte plant. Then the cycle repeats. 
Summary 	  • In vascular plants, the sporophyte generation is dominant. • In seedless vascular plants such as ferns, the sporophyte releases spores from the undersides of leaves. 
In the life cycle of a fern, the sporophyte 	  generation is dominant. • The spores develop into tiny, separate gametophytes, from which the next generation of sporophyte plants grows.

These pine cones have a prominent role in the gymnosperm life cycle. So what is the function of a pine cone? 
Life  Cycle of  Gymnosperms 	  Gymnosperms are vascular plants that produce seeds in cones. Examples include conifers such as pine and spruce trees. The gymnosperm life cycle has a dominant sporophyte generation. Both gametophytes and the next generation’s new sporophytes develop on the sporophyte parent plant. Figure 9.48 is a diagram of a gymnosperm life cycle. Cones form on a mature sporophyte plant. Inside male cones, male spores develop into male gametophytes. Each male gametophyte consists of several cells enclosed within a grain of pollen. Inside female cones, female spores develop into female gametophytes. Each female gametophyte produces an egg inside an ovule. Pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from a male to female cone. If sperm then travel from the pollen to an egg so fertilization can occur, a diploid zygote results. The zygote develops into an embryo within a seed, which forms from the ovule inside the female cone. If the seed germinates, it may grow into a mature sporophyte tree, which repeats the cycle. 
The gymnosperm life cycle follows the 	  general plant life cycle, but with some new adaptations. Can you identify them? 
Summary 	  • In gymnosperms, the gametophyte generation takes place in a cone, which forms on the mature sporophyte plant. • Each male gametophyte is just a few cells inside a grain of pollen. Each female gametophyte produces an egg inside an ovule. • Pollination must occur for fertilization to take place.

What’s the most successful type of plant? Flowering plants. Why? As you know, flowers come in many different styles and colors, and many are visually pleasing. This aids in pollination. Also notice the anatomy of this Hibiscus flower. Each part has evolved to play a role in the life cycle. 
Life  Cycle of  Angiosperms 	  Angiosperms, or flowering plants, are the most abundant and diverse plants on Earth. Angiosperms evolved several reproductive adaptations that have contributed to their success. Like all vascular plants, their life cycle is dominated by the sporophyte generation. A typical angiosperm life cycle is shown in Figure 9.49. The flower in Figure 9.49 is obviously an innovation in the angiosperm life cycle. Flowers form on the dominant sporophyte plant. They consist of highly specialized male and female reproductive organs. Flowers produce spores that develop into gametophytes. Male gametophytes consist of just a few cells within a pollen grain and produce sperm. Female gametophytes produce eggs inside the ovaries of flowers. Flowers also attract animal pollinators. If pollination and fertilization occur, a diploid zygote forms within an ovule in the ovary. The zygote develops into an embryo inside a seed, which forms from the ovule and also contains food to nourish the embryo. The ovary surrounding the seed may develop into a fruit. Fruits attract animals that may disperse the seeds they contain. If a seed germinates, it may grow into a mature sporophyte plant and repeat the cycle. See Life Cycle of a Flowering Plant at URL for additional information. 
Summary 	  • In flowering plants, the gametophyte generation takes place in a flower, which forms on the mature sporophyte plant. • Each male gametophyte is just a few cells inside a grain of pollen. Each female gametophyte produces an egg inside an ovule. • Pollination must occur for fertilization to take place.

Plant  Adaptations 	  Plants live just about everywhere on Earth. To live in so many different habitats, they have evolved adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce under a diversity of conditions. All plants are adapted to live on land. Or are they? All living plants today have terrestrial ancestors, but some plants now live in the water. They have had to evolve new adaptations for their watery habitat. 
Adaptations to  Water 	  Aquatic plants are plants that live in water. Living in water has certain advantages for plants. One advantage is, well, the water. There’s plenty of it and it’s all around. Therefore, most aquatic plants do not need adaptations for absorbing, transporting, and conserving water. They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root systems, vascular tissues, or thick cuticles on leaves. Support is also less of a problem because of the buoyancy of water. As a result, adaptations such as strong woody stems and deep anchoring roots are not necessary for most aquatic plants. Living in water does present challenges to plants, however. For one thing, pollination by wind or animals isn’t feasible under water, so aquatic plants may have adaptations that help them keep their flowers above water. For instance, water lilies have bowl-shaped flowers and broad, flat leaves that float. This allows the lilies to collect the maximum amount of sunlight, which does not penetrate very deeply below the water’s surface. Plants that live in moving water, such as streams and rivers, may have different adaptations. For example, cattails have narrow, strap-like leaves that reduce their resistance to the moving water (see Figure 9.50). Water lilies and cattails have different adaptations for life in the water. Compare the leaves of the two kinds of plants. How do the leaves help the plants adapt to their watery habitats? 
Adaptations to  Extreme  Dryness 	  Plants that live in extremely dry environments have the opposite problem: how to get and keep water. Plants that are adapted to very dry environments are called xerophytes. Their adaptations may help them increase water intake, decrease water loss, or store water when it is available. The saguaro cactus pictured in Figure 9.51 has adapted in all three ways. When it was still a very small plant, just a few inches high, its shallow roots already reached out as much as 2 meters (7 feet) from the base of the stem. By now, its root system is much more widespread. It allows the cactus to gather as much moisture as possible from rare rainfalls. The saguaro doesn’t have any leaves to lose water by transpiration. It also has a large, barrel-shaped stem that can store a lot of water. Thorns protect the stem from thirsty animals that might try to get at the water inside. The saguaro cactus has many adaptations for extreme dryness. How does it store water? 
Adaptations to  Air 	  Plants called epiphytes grow on other plants. They obtain moisture from the air and make food by photosynthesis. Most epiphytes are ferns or orchids that live in tropical or temperate rainforests (see Figure 9.52). Host trees provide support, allowing epiphyte plants to obtain air and sunlight high above the forest floor. Being elevated above the ground lets epiphytes get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can get enough sunlight for photosynthesis. Being elevated may also reduce the risk of being eaten by herbivores and increase the chance of pollination by wind. These Elkhorn and Staghorn ferns are growing on a rainforest tree as epiphytes. Epiphytes don’t grow in soil, so they may not have roots. However, they still need water for photosynthesis. Rainforests are humid, so the plants may be able to absorb the water they need from the air. However, many epiphytes have evolved modified leaves or other structures for collecting rainwater, fog, or dew. The leaves of the bromeliad shown in Figure 9.53 are rolled into funnel shapes to collect rainwater. The base of the leaves forms a tank that can hold more than 8 liters (2 gallons) of water. Some insects and amphibians may spend their whole life cycle in the pool of water in the tank, adding minerals to the water with their wastes. The tissues at the base of the leaf are absorbent, so they can take in both water and minerals from the tank. The leaves of this bromeliad are specialized to collect, store, and absorb rainwater.

Explain your answer. • Define tropism. • Identify types of plant responses to environmental stimuli. • Distinguish between geotropism and phototropism. • Explain the function of auxin. • Explain the benefits of dormancy. So what happens to a vineyard in the middle of winter? The vines cannot die each year. Instead, the plants go into a state of dormancy, almost as if they are taking a long nap. 
Plant  Responses 	  Like all organisms, plants detect and respond to stimuli in their environment. Unlike animals, plants can’t run, fly, or swim toward food or away from danger. They are usually rooted to the soil. Instead, a plant’s primary means of response is to change how it is growing. Plants also don’t have a nervous system to control their responses. Instead, their responses are generally controlled by hormones, which are chemical messenger molecules. 
Plant  Tropisms 	  Plant roots always grow downward because specialized cells in root caps detect and respond to gravity. This is an example of a tropism. A tropism is a turning toward or away from a stimulus in the environment. Growing toward gravity is called geotropism. Plants also exhibit phototropism, or growing toward a light source. This response is controlled by a plant growth hormone called auxin. As shown in Figure 9.54, auxin stimulates cells on the dark side of a plant to grow longer. This causes the plant to bend toward the light. 
Phototropism is controlled by the growth 	  hormone auxin. 
Daily and  Seasonal  Responses 	  Plants also detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness. For example, some plants open their leaves during the day to collect sunlight and then close their leaves at night to prevent water loss. Environmental stimuli that indicate changing seasons trigger other responses. Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by going dormant. They suspend growth and development in order to survive the extreme cold and dryness of winter. Dormancy ensures that seeds will germinate and plants will grow only when conditions are favorable. 
Responses to  Disease 	  Plants don’t have immune systems, but they do respond to disease. Typically, their first line of defense is the death of cells surrounding infected tissue. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants also produce hormones and toxins to fight pathogens. For example, willow trees produce salicylic acid to kill bacteria. The same compound is used in many acne products for the same reason. Exciting new research suggests that plants may even produce chemicals that warn other plants of threats to their health, allowing the plants to prepare for their own defense. As these and other responses show, plants may be rooted in place, but they are far from helpless.

Introduction 	  What traits do all animals share? And is their behavior innate or learned? There is great variation among species that make up the animal kingdom. Some of this variation is shown in the figure above. Despite the variation, there are a number of traits that are shared by all animals. The fact that all animals have certain traits in common shows that they share a common ancestor. Characteristics, classification, and behavior of animals will be addressed in the Animals chapter. • Draw an animal cell and label significant structures. • Identify characteristics common to all animals. • Describe the basic animal life cycle. Is an insect an animal? Of course it is. Is a snail an insect? No, snails are mollusks. Notice the large "foot" that allows movement, and the antennas are obvious. Actually, a snail’s eyes are on the two long projections on its head, and the projections are called eyestalks. These are characteristics of this animal. 
Characteristics of  Animals 	  Animals are a kingdom of multicellular eukaryotes. They cannot make their own food. Instead, they get nutrients by eating other living things. Therefore, animals are heterotrophs. 
Animal  Cells 	  Like the cells of all eukaryotes, animal cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles (see Figure 10.1). Unlike the cells of plants and fungi, animal cells lack a cell wall. This gives animal cells flexibility. It lets them take on different shapes so they can become specialized to do particular jobs. The human nerve cell shown in Figure would be unable to take this shape if it were surrounded by a rigid cell wall. 
Animal  Cell.  The shape of an animal cell 	  is not constrained by a rigid cell wall. A bacterial cell is shown above for comparison. 
Animal  Structure and  Function 	  Animals not only have specialized cells. Most animals also have tissues and organs. In many animals, organs form organ systems, such as a nervous system. Higher levels of organization allow animals to perform many complex functions. What can animals do that most other living things cannot? Most animals share these characteristics: sensory organs, movement, and internal digestion. All of them are illustrated in Figure 10.3. • Animals can detect environmental stimuli, such as light, sound, and touch. Stimuli are detected by sensory nerve cells. The information is transmitted and processed by the nervous system. The nervous system, in turn, may direct the body to respond. Animal Eyes at URL has 26 images of the eyes of various animals. • All animals can move, at least during some stage of their life cycle. Muscles and nerves work together to allow movement. Being able to move lets animals actively search for food and mates. It also helps them escape from predators. • Virtually all animals have internal digestion of food. Animals consume other organisms and may use special tissues and organs to digest them. (Many other organisms absorb nutrients directly from the environment.) 
Animal  Life  Cycle and  Reproduction 	  Many animals have a relatively simple life cycle. A general animal life cycle is shown in Figure 10.4. Most animals spend the majority of their life as diploid organisms. Just about all animals reproduce sexually. Diploid adults 
Human  Nerve  Cell.  A human nerve cell 	  is specialized to transmit nerve impulses.

They also have sexual reproduction.

Animal  Life  Cycle.  An animal 	  life cycle that includes only sexual reproduction is shown here. Some animals also reproduce asexually. How does the animal life cycle compare with the life cycle of a plant? • Organism Needs at URL -9c76-4d2d1f85ddd4 . difference? • Give an overview of animal classification. • Give examples of animals in the major animal phyla. • Define vertebrate and invertebrate. Plant or animal? Animal. What type? Now that is a good question. This azure vase sponge is an animal, but how is it classified? It is estimated that there are easily over a million species of animals on Earth. How are all these species divided into their various classifications? 
Classification of  Animals 	  All animals share basic traits. But animals also show a lot of diversity. They range from simple sponges to complex humans. 
Major  Animal  Phyla 	  Members of the animal kingdom are divided into more than 30 phyla. Table 10.1 lists the nine phyla with the greatest number of species. Each of the animal phyla listed in the table has at least 10,000 species.

Invertebrate vs.  Vertebrate 	  The first eight phyla listed in Table 10.1 include only invertebrate animals. Invertebrates are animals that lack a vertebral column, or backbone. The last phylum in the table, the Chordata, also includes many invertebrate species. Tunicates and lancelets are both invertebrates. Altogether, invertebrates make up at least 95 percent of all animal species. The remaining animals are vertebrates. Vertebrates are animals that have a backbone. All vertebrates belong to the phylum Chordata. They include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. 
Summary 	  • Vertebrates have a backbone, but invertebrates do not. • Except for the chordates, all animal phyla consist only of invertebrates. • Chordates include both vertebrates and invertebrates. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Animal Classification at URL . • Define animal behavior. • Summarize the nature-nurture debate. • Explain how animal behaviors evolve. What is this elephant doing? Obviously he is spraying the zebras with water. Why? Is this elephant playing or is there another reason he is spraying the zebras? The elephant is actually trying to keep the zebras away from the waterhole. This is considered an animal behavior. 
Animal  Behavior 	  Did you ever see a dog sit on command? Have you ever watched a cat trying to catch a mouse? These are just two examples of the many behaviors of animals. Animal behavior includes all the ways that animals interact with each other and the environment. Examples of common animal behaviors are pictured in Figure 10.5. The branch of biology that studies animal behavior is called ethology. Ethologists usually study how animals behave in their natural environment, rather than in a lab. They generally try to answer four basic questions about the behaviors they observe: of the animal are involved in the behavior? certain experiences needed for the behavior to develop? it affect the survival of the species? did the behavior first appear? Examples of Animal Behavior. Can you think of other examples of animal behavior besides the three shown here? 
Evolution of  Animal  Behavior 	  To the extent that behaviors are controlled by genes, they may evolve through natural selection. If behaviors increase fitness, they are likely to become more common over time. If they decrease fitness, they are likely to become less common. 
Nature vs.  Nurture 	  Some behaviors seem to be controlled solely by genes. Others appear to be due to experiences in a given environment. Whether behaviors are controlled mainly by genes or by the environment is often a matter of debate. This is called the nature-nurture debate. Nature refers to the genes an animal inherits. Nurture refers to the environment that the animal experiences. In reality, most animal behaviors are not controlled by nature or nurture alone. Instead, they are influenced by both nature and nurture. In dogs, for example, the tendency to behave toward other dogs in a certain way is probably controlled by genes. However, the normal behaviors can’t develop in an environment that lacks other dogs. A puppy raised in isolation from other dogs may never develop the normal behaviors. It may always fear other dogs or act aggressively toward them. 
How  Behaviors  Evolve 	  It’s easy to see how many common types of behavior evolve. That’s because they obviously increase the fitness of the animal performing them. For example, when wolves hunt together in a pack, they are more likely to catch prey (see Figure 10.6). Therefore, hunting with others increases a wolf’s fitness. The wolf is more likely to survive and pass its genes to the next generation by behaving this way. The evolution of certain other types of behavior is not as easy to explain. An example is a squirrel chattering loudly to warn other squirrels that a predator is near. This is likely to help the other squirrels avoid the predator. Therefore, it could increase their fitness. But what about the squirrel raises the alarm? This squirrel is more likely to be noticed by the predator. Therefore, the behavior may actually lower this squirrel’s fitness. How could such a behavior evolve through natural selection? One possible answer is that helping others often means helping close relatives. Close relatives share many of the together in packs. 
Wolves hunt 	  is adaptive because it increases their chances of killing prey and obtaining food. same genes that they inherited from their common ancestor. As a result, helping a close relative may actually increase the chances that copies of one’s own genes will be passed to the next generation. In this way, a behavior that puts oneself at risk could actually increase through natural selection. This form of natural selection is called kin selection. 
Summary 	  • Most animal behaviors are controlled by both genes and experiences in a given environment. • To the extent that behaviors are controlled by genes, they may evolve. • Behaviors that improve fitness increase through natural selection. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • The Theme of Evolution in Animal Behavior at URL . • Define innate behavior and reflex. • Give examples of innate behaviors. • Explain the role of a stimulus. Is this Blue-footed Booby actually dancing? The courtship of the Blue-footed Booby consists of the male flaunting his blue feet and dancing to impress the female. During the dance, the male will spread his wings and stamp his feet on the ground. Are these birds born with this skill, or do they learn it? 
Innate  Behavior 	  Behaviors that are closely controlled by genes with little or no environmental influence are called innate behaviors. These are behaviors that occur naturally in all members of a species whenever they are exposed to a certain stimulus. Innate behaviors do not have to be learned or practiced. They are also called instinctive behaviors. An instinct is the ability of an animal to perform a behavior the first time it is exposed to the proper stimulus. For example, a dog will drool the first time—and every time—it is exposed to food. 
Significance of  Innate  Behavior 	  Innate behaviors are rigid and predictable. All members of the species perform the behaviors in the same way. Innate behaviors usually involve basic life functions, such as finding food or caring for offspring. Several examples are shown in Figure 10.7. If an animal were to perform such important behaviors incorrectly, it would be less likely to survive or reproduce. Examples of Innate Behavior. These innate behaviors are necessary for survival or reproduction. Can you explain why each behavior is important? 
Intelligence and  Innate  Behavior 	  Innate behaviors occur in all animals. However, they are less common in species with higher levels of intelligence. Humans are the most intelligent species, and they have very few innate behaviors. The only innate behaviors in humans are reflexes. A reflex is a response that always occurs when a certain stimulus is present. For example, a human infant will grasp an object, such as a finger, that is placed in its palm. The infant has no control over this reaction because it is innate. Other than reflexes such as this, human behaviors are learned–or at least influenced by experience—rather than being innate. 
Innate  Behavior in  Human  Beings 	  All animals have innate behaviors, even human beings. Can you think of human behaviors that do not have to be learned? Chances are, you will have a hard time thinking of any. The only truly innate behaviors in humans are called reflex behaviors. They occur mainly in babies. Like innate behaviors in other animals, reflex behaviors in human babies may help them survive. An example of a reflex behavior in babies is the sucking reflex. Newborns instinctively suck on a nipple that is placed in their mouth. It is easy to see how this behavior evolved. It increases the chances of a baby feeding and surviving. Another example of a reflex behavior in babies is the grasp reflex ( Figure 10.8). Babies instinctively grasp an object placed in the palm of their hand. Their grip may be surprisingly strong. How do you think this behavior might increase a baby’s chances of surviving? One of the few innate behaviors in human beings is the grasp reflex. occurs only in babies. 
Summary 	  • Innate behaviors are instinctive. They are controlled by genes and always occur in the same way. • Innate behaviors do not have to be learned or practiced. • Innate behaviors generally involve basic life functions, so it’s important that they be performed correctly. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Innate Behaviors: Movement and Migration at URL ate-behaviors-movement-and-migration-940-12199/ . • Define learning and insight learning. • State ways that animals learn. • Give examples of learned behaviors. Fighting or playing? You might think that these young tigers are fighting, but they’re really just playing. Like most other young mammals, tigers like to play. Why do mammals play? Is playing just for fun, or does it serve some other purpose as well? Playing is actually an important way of learning. By playing, these tigers are learning moves that will help them become successful predators as adults. Playing is just one of many ways that mammals and other animals learn how to behave. 
Learned  Behavior 	  Learning is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of experience. Compared with innate behaviors, learned behaviors are more flexible. They can be modified to suit changing conditions. This may make them more adaptive than innate behaviors. For example, drivers may have to modify how they drive (a learned behavior) when roads are wet or icy. Otherwise, they may lose control of their vehicle. Animals may learn behaviors in a variety of ways. Some ways are quite simple. Others are more complex. Several types of learning are described in Figure 10.9. 
Insight  Learning 	  Insight learning, which is based on past experience and reasoning, is a hallmark of the human animal. Humans have used insight learning to solve problems ranging from starting a fire to traveling to the moon. It usually involves 
Types of  Learning.  Five different ways 	  that animals may learn behaviors are shown here. What have you learned in each of these ways? coming up with new ways to solve problems. Insight learning generally happens quickly. An animal has a sudden flash of insight. Insight learning requires relatively great intelligence. Human beings use insight learning more than any other species. They have used their intelligence to solve problems ranging from inventing the wheel to flying rockets into space. Think about problems you have solved. Maybe you figured out how to solve a new type of math problem or how to get to the next level of a video game. If you relied on your past experiences and reasoning to do it, then you were using insight learning. One type of insight learning is making tools to solve problems. Scientists used to think that humans were the only animals intelligent enough to make tools. In fact, tool-making was believed to set humans apart from all other animals. In 1960, primate expert Jane Goodall discovered that chimpanzees also make tools. She saw a chimpanzee strip leaves from a twig. Then he poked the twig into a hole in a termite mound. After termites climbed onto the twig, he pulled the twig out of the hole and ate the insects clinging to it. The chimpanzee had made a tool to “fish” for termites. He had used insight to solve a problem. Since then, chimpanzees have been seen making several different types of tools. For example, they sharpen sticks and use them as spears for hunting. They use stones as hammers to crack open nuts. Scientists have also observed other species of animals making tools to solve problems. A crow was seen bending a piece of wire into a hook. Then the crow used the hook to pull food out of a tube. An example of a gorilla using a walking stick is shown below ( Figure 10.10). Behaviors such as these show that other species of animals can use their experience and reasoning to solve problems. They can learn through insight. 
Summary 	  • Learning is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of experience. • Learned behaviors are adaptive because they are flexible. They can change if the environment changes. • Behaviors can be learned in several different ways, including through play. This gorilla is using a branch as a tool.

Playing or fighting? This display of aggression may be over a mate or land. But they definitely are not playing. This fight will continue until one is badly injured and flees, or the fight may continue to the death. 
Social  Behaviors 	  Different types of behavior evolved in animals because the behaviors helped them survive or reproduce. In many species, animals live together in a close-knit group with other members of their species. Such a group is referred to as a society. Animals that live in a society are known as social animals. They live and work together for the good of the group. This is called cooperation. Generally, each member of the group has a specific role that it plays in the society. Cooperation allows the group to do many things that a lone animal could never do. Look at the ants in their society. 
Communication 	  For individuals to cooperate, they need to communicate. Animals can communicate with sounds, chemicals, or visual cues. For example, to communicate with sounds, birds sing and frogs croak. Both may be communicating that they are good mates. Ants communicate with chemicals called pheromones. For example, they use the chemicals 
Cooperation in a  Social  Insect.  These 	  ants are cooperating in a task that a single ant would be too small to do alone. to mark trails to food sources so other ants can find them. Male dogs use pheromones in urine to mark their territory. They are “telling” other dogs to stay out of their yard. You can see several examples of visual communication in Visual Communication in Animals. Many animals use visual cues to communicate. 
Aggression 	  Aggression is behavior that is intended to cause harm or pain. 
It may involve physical violence against other 	  individuals. For example, two male gorillas may fight and use their canine teeth to inflict deep wounds. Expressing aggression this way may lead to serious injury and even death. In many species display behaviors, rather than actual physical attacks, are used to show aggression. This helps prevent injury and death. Male gorillas, for example, are more likely to put on a display of aggression than to attack another male. In fact, gorillas have a whole series of display behaviors that they use to show aggression. They beat on their chest, dash back and forth, and pound the ground with their hands. 
Competition 	  Aggressive behavior often occurs when individuals compete for the same resources. Animals may compete for territory, water, food, or mates. There are two basic types of competition: intraspecific and interspecific. • Intraspecific competition occurs between members of the same species. For example, two male deer may compete for mates by clashing their antlers together. • Interspecific competition occurs between members of different species. For example, one species of ant may attack and take over the colony of another ant species.

The seventh greatest wonder in the world. Really? The Masai Mara Wildebeest Migration. The annual wildebeest migration in Kenya and Tanzania is arguably the most spectacular natural event in Africa. More than 3 million large mammals have made the vast Masai Mara and Serengeti plains their home, and each summer they migrate, looking for greener pastures. And yes, some call it "the seventh greatest wonder in the world." 
Cyclic  Behaviors 	  Many animal behaviors occur in a regular cycle. Two types of cyclic behaviors are circadian rhythms and migration. Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. 
In humans, for 	  example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock. This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. Migration refers to seasonal movements of animals from one area to another. Migrants typically travel long distances, and travel the same paths each seasonal cycle. Usually, the migrants move to another area in order to find food or mates. Many birds, fish, and insects migrate. Mammals such as whales and caribou migrate as well. cycle is hibernation. Hibernation is a state in which an animal’s body processes are slower than usual, and its body temperature falls. An animal uses less energy than usual during hibernation. This helps the animal survive during a time of year when food is scarce. Hibernation may last for weeks or months. Animals that hibernate include species of bats, squirrels, and snakes. Most people think that bears hibernate. In fact, bears do not go into true hibernation. In the winter, they go into a deep sleep. However, their body processes do not slow down very much. Their body temperature also remains about the same as usual. Bears can be awakened easily from their winter sleep.

So when does the peacock extend his tail? Peafowl are best known for the male’s extravagant tail. Obviously though, a peacock cannot have his tail extended continuously. It would make it very difficult to move around. And it may be very tiring. So when does the peacock extend his tail? The peacock displays his tail as part of courtship. 
Mating and  Courtship 	  Mating refers to the union of a male and female of the same species for reproduction. The relationship between mates varies by species. Adults may have many mates, or they may mate with just one individual. Mates may stay together only while mating, for an entire breeding season, or even for life. Females are likely to be more selective than males in choosing mates. In many species, males put on courtship displays to encourage females to choose them as mates. For example, to attract a mate, a male bowerbird builds an elaborate nest decorated with hundreds of small blue objects (see Figure 10.14). 
Parental  Care 	  In most species of fish, amphibians, and reptiles, parents provide no care to their offspring. In birds and mammals, on the other hand, parental care is common. Most often, the mother provides the care. However, in some species, 
Bowerbird  Decorating  His  Nest.  A male 	  bowerbird spends many hours collecting bits of blue glass and other small blue objects to decorate his nest. A female bowerbird inspects the nests of many males before choosing as a mate the male with the best nest. both parents or just the father may be involved. Parental care is generally longest and most involved in mammals. Besides feeding and protecting their offspring, parents may teach their offspring skills they will need to survive on their own. For example, meerkat adults teach their pups how to eat scorpions. They show the pups how to safely handle the poisonous insects and how to remove the stingers. 
This mother killdeer is pretending she has 	  a broken wing. She is trying to attract a predator’s attention in order to protect her chicks. This behavior puts her at risk of harm. How can it increase her fitness? 
Defending  Territory 	  Some species of animals are territorial. This means that they defend their area. The area they defend usually contains their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring. A species is more likely to be territorial if there is not very much food in their area. Animals generally do not defend their territory by fighting. Instead, they are more likely to use display behavior. The behavior tells other animals to stay away. It gets the message across without the need for fighting. Display behavior is generally safer and uses less energy than fighting. Male gorillas use display behavior to defend their territory. They pound on their chests and thump the ground with their hands to warn other male gorillas to keep away from their area. The robin displays his red breast to warn other robins to stay away ( Figure 10.16). 
The red breast of this male robin is easy 	  to see. The robin displays his bright red chest to defend his territory. It warns other robins to keep out of his area. Some animals deposit chemicals to mark the boundary of their territory. This is why dogs urinate on fire hydrants and other objects. Cats may also mark their territory by depositing chemicals. They have scent glands in their face. They deposit chemicals by rubbing their face against objects.

Introduction 	  Why does not having a backbone make things so complex? Invertebrates could be described as simple animals. And though some are very simple, the vastness of the invertebrate species makes this group of animals anything but simple. Characteristics, evolution, and classification of invertebrates will be discussed in the Invertebrates chapter. 
Invertebrates 	  • Describe general characteristics of invertebrates. • Distinguish between a complete and incomplete digestive system. • Describe ways of invertebrate movement. • Describe invertebrate reproduction. What type of animal is a Sea Cucumber? That is a Sea Cucumber, and it is an animal. The Sea Cucumber is a soft-bodied invertebrate that is related to the starfish and sea urchins. There are over 1,100 species that are found worldwide in intertidal zones as well as deep waters. 
Characteristics of  Invertebrates 	  The majority of animals today are invertebrates. They have a wide range of physical traits and ways of life. Modern invertebrates include animals as different as the sponge and tarantula. Why are both of these animals classified as invertebrates? What traits do they have common? One trait invertebrates like the sponge and tarantula share is lack of a backbone. In fact, they don’t have any bones at all. These are defining traits of all invertebrates. Some invertebrates have a skeleton, but it isn’t made of bone. Many other traits of invertebrates show considerable diversity. 
Digestion 	  Invertebrates have one of two types of digestive system: an incomplete or complete digestive system. Both are shown in Figure 11.2. An incomplete digestive system consists of a digestive cavity with one opening. The single opening serves as both mouth and anus. A complete digestive system consists of a digestive tract with two openings. One opening is the mouth. The other is the anus. Invertebrates. 
Examples of 	  sponge (left) and tarantula (right) are invertebrates. Can you identify any traits they share? Two Types of Digestive Systems in Invertebrates. On the left is an incomplete digestive system, found in a jellyfish; on the right is the complete digestive system of a roundworm. Invertebrates may have either of these two types of digestive system. Find the parts of each digestive system in each drawing. How do the two systems differ? 
Movement 	  All invertebrates can move on their own during at least some stage of their life cycle. However, they may differ in how they move. Several ways are described below. • Some invertebrates are simply carried along by water currents. They cannot control their movement in a particular direction. An example is a jellyfish. • Other invertebrates can contract muscles to move independently of water currents or on solid surfaces. They can also control the direction in which they move. An example is a roundworm. It can move forward and to the left or right. • Still other invertebrates have specialized appendages for movement. For example, they may have jointed legs for walking or climbing or wings for flying. An example is an insect such as a fly. 
Invertebrates 	  Most invertebrates have a nervous system. The nervous system allows them to sense and respond to their environment. The simplest invertebrate nervous system is just a network of nerves that can sense touch, called a nerve net (see Figure 11.3). Most invertebrates have a more complex nervous system. It may include a brain and several different sense organs. The nervous system of invertebrates. 
Reproduction 	  Most invertebrates reproduce sexually. Diploid adults produce haploid gametes (sperm and eggs). In some species, the same individuals produce both sperm and eggs. In other species, sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female individuals. Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid zygote. The zygote develops into an embryo and eventually into a new adult organism. On the way, it may pass through one or more larval stages. A larva (plural, larvae) is a juvenile, or immature, stage of an animal. It is generally quite different in form and function from the adult form of the species. For example, the larva may be able to swim freely, whereas the adult must remain permanently attached to a solid surface. Some invertebrates can also reproduce asexually. This may occur by fission or budding. Fission takes place when an animal simply divides into two parts. Each part then regrows the missing part. The result is two whole organisms. Budding may take place when a parent forms a small bump, or bud. The bud remains attached to the parent while it develops into a new individual. 
Summary 	  • The majority of living animals are invertebrates. Invertebrates lack a backbone. • Invertebrates may have an incomplete or a complete digestive system. • Invertebrates vary in how they move and in the complexity of their nervous system. • Most invertebrates reproduce sexually. After hatching, many invertebrates pass through one or more larval stages that are different from the adult stage.

Invertebrates 	  • Outline major events in invertebrate evolution. • Explain the importance of multicellularity. • Compare ectoderm to endoderm to mesoderm. • Compare radial symmetry to bilateral symmetry. • Define cephalization. • Describe a complete digestive system. • Compare a pseudocoelom to a coelom. • Explain segmentation. • Define notochord. How many different types of beetles are there? There are about 350,000 species of beetles spread all over the world. But let’s focus on this one. Look at the detail on this Rhinoceros beetle. The horns are used in fighting other males during mating season, and for digging. The body of an adult rhino beetle is covered by a thick exoskeleton. A pair of thick wings lay atop another set of wings underneath, allowing the rhinoceros beetle to fly. Compare those evolutionary adaptations to a simple sponge, and the evolutionary significance of invertebrates becomes obvious. 
Invertebrate  Evolution 	  Invertebrates evolved several important traits before vertebrates even appeared. These traits are now found in just about all animals. 
Multicellularity 	  The first animal trait to evolve was multicellularity. This was highly adaptive. Multiple cells could do different jobs. They could evolve special adaptations that allowed them to do their job really well. However, the first invertebrates still lacked tissues. Sponges represent the first organism at the multicellular stage of invertebrate evolution. 
Tissues 	  Living cnidarians, such as jellyfish, represent the next stage of invertebrate evolution. This was the evolution of tissues. It was the first step in the evolution of organs and organ systems. At first, invertebrates developed tissues from just two embryonic cell layers. There was an outer cell layer called ectoderm and an inner cell layer called endoderm. The two cell layers allowed different types of tissues to form. 
Radial  Symmetry 	  Another trait that evolved early on was symmetry. To understand symmetry, you need to see an animal that lacks symmetry. A sponge, like the one in Figure 11.4, lacks symmetry. This means it cannot be divided into two identical halves. A symmetrical organism, in contrast, can be divided into two identical halves. Both the coral polyp and the beetle in Figure 11.4 have symmetry. Symmetry in Invertebrates. Sponges lack symmetry. Radial symmetry evolved first. This was followed by bilateral symmetry. How do the two types of symmetry differ? The coral polyp in Figure 11.4 has radial symmetry. This was the first type of symmetry to evolve. The coral has a distinct top and bottom but not distinct ends. It can be divided into identical halves like a pie, but not into right and left halves. Animals with radial symmetry have no sense of directions such as forward and backward or left and right. This makes controlled movement in these directions impossible. 
Invertebrates 	  Flatworms represent the next stage of invertebrate evolution. They evolved cephalization. This is the concentration of nerve tissue at one end of the body, forming a head region. This is highly adaptive. It allows central control of the entire organism. Cephalization was first step in the evolution of a brain. 
Bilateral  Symmetry 	  An outcome of cephalization was bilateral symmetry. This is demonstrated by the beetle in Figure 11.4. With concentrated nerve tissue at the head but not at the tail end, the two ends of the body are distinct from each other. The animal can be divided down the middle to form identical right and left halves. It allows the animal to tell front from back and left from right. This is needed for controlled movements in these directions. 
Mesoderm 	  Ancestors of flatworms also evolved mesoderm. This is a third layer of cells between the ectoderm and the endoderm (see Figure 11.5). Evolution of this new cell layer allowed animals to develop new types of tissues, such as muscle. Three Cell Layers in a Flatworm. A flatworm has three cell layers. 
Complete  Digestive  System 	  Early invertebrates had an incomplete digestive system. There was just one opening for the mouth and anus. Ancestors of modern roundworms were the first animals to evolve a complete digestive system. With a separate mouth and anus, food could move through the body in just one direction. This made digestion more efficient. An animal could keep eating while digesting food and getting rid of waste. Different parts of the digestive tract could also become specialized for different digestive functions. This led to the evolution of digestive organs. 
Pseudocoelom and  Coelom 	  Ancestors of roundworms also evolved a pseudocoelom. This is a partial body cavity that is filled with fluid. It allows room for internal organs to develop. The fluid also cushions the internal organs. The pressure of the fluid within the cavity provides stiffness. It gives the body internal support, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. It explains why roundworms are round and flatworms are flat. Later, a true coelom evolved. This is a fluid-filled body cavity, completely enclosed by mesoderm. It lies between the digestive cavity and body wall (see Figure 11.6). Invertebrates with a true coelom include mollusks and annelids. 
Coelom.  The coelom forms within the 	  mesoderm. 
Segmented  Body 	  Segmentation evolved next. This is a division of the body into multiple segments. Both the earthworm and ant pictured in Figure 11.7 have segmented bodies. This trait increases flexibility. It permits a wider range of motion. All annelids and arthropods are segmented. Arthropods also evolved jointed appendages. For example, they evolved jointed legs for walking and “feelers” (antennae) for sensing. 
Notochord 	  Some invertebrates evolved a notochord. This is the stiff support rod in a chordate. The first chordates were probably similar to modern invertebrate chordates. The sea squirt in Figure 11.8 is an example. Later, some invertebrate chordates evolved into vertebrates. 
Summary 	  • Many important traits evolved in invertebrates. They include: multicellularity, tissues and organs, radial and bilateral symmetry, cephalization, mesoderm, complete digestive system, coelom, segmented body, and notochord.

Invertebrates 	  • Give an overview of invertebrate classification. • Give examples of animals in the major invertebrate phyla. • Distinguish between protostomes and deuterostomes. Invertebrate, arthropod or insect? This Monarch caterpillar is an invertebrate. It is also an insect and an arthropod. Of all the animal species, it is estimated that well over 90% are invertebrates. Of all invertebrates, the insects are by far the most numerous. There are so many species of insects that scientists have yet to discover them all, let alone name or count them. Estimates of the total number of insect species fall in the range of 1 to 30 million. So, it helps if there are methods to classify not just the insects, but all invertebrates. 
Classification of  Invertebrates 	  Eight major phyla contain the majority of invertebrate species.

The two groups are called protostomes and deuterostomes. As shown in Figure 11.9, organisms in the two groups have different ways of forming the coelom and mouth, among other differences. Mollusks, annelids, and arthropods are protostomes. Echinoderms and chordates are deuterostomes. This distinction is important. Why does it matter? It shows that echinoderms are more closely related to chordates than are the other invertebrate phyla. This is not apparent based on other, more obvious traits.

Why? • Describe invertebrates in the phylum Porifera. • Describe spicules. • Outline feeding in sponges. • Explain reproduction in sponges. So what exactly is a sponge? Here we have a giant barrel sponge. How can something that looks like that be considered an animal? Where’s the head? Where are the legs? Where’s the mouth? 
Sponges 	  Invertebrates are animals without a backbone. They are the most numerous animals on Earth. Most invertebrates are insects. However, simpler invertebrates evolved before insects. Some, like the sponges you will read about in this concept, have existed virtually unchanged for hundreds of millions of years. Their continued existence is evidence that they are well adapted for their habitats. They also evolved some of the most important traits that are found in almost all animals today. Without the traits that evolved in sponges and other simple invertebrates, you would not exist. Sponges are aquatic invertebrates that make up the phylum Porifera. The word "porifera" means pore-bearing. The phylum is aptly named. As you can see from Figure 11.10, a sponge has a porous body. There are at least 5,000 living species of sponges. Almost all of them inhabit the ocean, living mainly on coral reefs or the ocean floor. See The First Animal at URL for an introduction to sponges. 
Structure and  Function of  Sponges 	  Sponges come in a variety of shapes and sizes. For example, they may be shaped like tubes, fans, cones, or just blobs. They range in diameter from about a centimeter (0.4 inches) to over a meter (3.3 feet). Many species live in 
Invertebrates 	  Sponge on a Coral Reef. This orange sponge is covered with pores. Can you predict the function of the pores? colonies that may be quite large. Adult sponges are sessile. This means they are unable to move from place to place. Root-like projections anchor them to solid surfaces such as rocks and reefs. Sponges have an internal skeleton that gives them support and protection. An internal skeleton is called an endoskeleton. A sponge endoskeleton consists of short, sharp rods called spicules (see Figure 11.11). Spicules are made of silica, calcium carbonate, or spongin, a tough protein. They grow from specialized cells in the body of the sponge. 
Sponge  Anatomy.  A sponge lacks tissues 	  and organs, but it has several types of specialized cells. Sponges are filter feeders. They pump water into their body through their pores. The water flows through a large central cavity called the spongocoel (see Figure 11.11). As the water flows by, specialized collar cells (which are also known as choanocytes) filter out food particles such as bacteria. Collar cells have tiny hairs that trap the particles. They also have a flagellum that whips the water and keeps it moving. Once the food is trapped, the collar cells digest it (see Figure 11.12). Cells called amebocytes also help digest the food. They distribute the nutrients to the rest of the body as well. Finally, the water flows back out of the body through an opening called the osculum. As water flows through the sponge, oxygen diffuses from the water to the sponge’s cells. The cells also expel wastes into the water for removal through the osculum. 
Collar  Cell.  The collar cells of sponges 	  trap and digest food. 
Sponge  Reproduction 	  Sponges reproduce both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction occurs by budding. Figure 11.13 shows the sponge life cycle when sexual reproduction is involved. Adult sponges produce eggs and sperm. In many species, the same individuals produce both. However, they don’t produce eggs and sperm at the same time. As a result, self-fertilization is unlikely to occur. What is an advantage of avoiding self-fertilization? Sperm are released into the surrounding water through the osculum. If they enter a female sponge through a pore, they may be trapped by collar cells. Trapped sperm are delivered to eggs inside the female body, where fertilization takes place. The resulting zygote develops into a larva. Unlike the adult, the larva is motile. It is covered with cilia that propel it through the water. As the larva grows, it becomes more similar to an adult sponge and loses its ability to swim. 
Invertebrates 	  The sponge life cycle includes sexual reproduction. Sponges may also reproduce asexually. 
Ecology of  Sponges 	  Sponges that live on coral reefs have symbiotic relationships with other reef species. They provide shelter for algae, shrimp, and crabs. In return, they get nutrients from the metabolism of the organisms they shelter. Sponges are a source of food for many species of fish. Because sponges are sessile, they cannot flee from predators. Their sharp spicules provide some defense. They also produce toxins that may poison predators that try to eat them.

The sea anemone. Plant or animal? It may look like a plant, but it’s not. Sea anemones are a group of water-dwelling, predatory animals in the phylum Cnidaria. A sea anemone is a polyp attached at the bottom to the surface beneath it. They can have anywhere from a few tens of tentacles to a few hundred tentacles. And they eat small fish and shrimp. 
Cnidarians 	  Cnidarians are invertebrates such as jellyfish and corals. They belong to the phylum Cnidaria. All cnidarians are aquatic. Most of them live in the ocean. Cnidarians are a little more complex than sponges. They have radial symmetry and tissues. There are more than 10,000 cnidarian species. They are very diverse, as shown in Figure at URL for an overview of these animals. 
Structure and  Function of  Cnidarians 	  All cnidarians have something in common. It’s a nematocyst, like the one shown in Figure 11.15. A nematocyst is a long, thin, coiled stinger. It has a barb that may inject poison. These tiny poison "darts" are propelled out of special cells. They are used to attack prey or defend against predators. There are two basic body plans in cnidarians. They are called the polyp and medusa. Both are shown in Figure 
Cnidarian  Diversity.  Cnidarians show a lot 	  of variability. Cnidarian Nematocyst. A cnidarian nematocyst is like a poison dart. It is ejected from a specialized cell. 
Invertebrates 	  and is typically motile. Some cnidarian species alternate between polyp and medusa forms. Other species exist in just one form or the other. Cnidarian Body Plans. Cnidarians may exist in the polyp (left) or medusa (right) form. The body of a cnidarian consists of two cell layers, ectoderm and endoderm. The cells surround a digestive cavity called the coelenteron (see Figure 11.17). Cnidarians have a simple digestive system. The single opening is surrounded by tentacles, which are used to capture prey. The tentacles are covered with nematocyst cells. Digestion takes place in the coelenteron. Nutrients are absorbed and gases exchanged through the cells lining this cavity. Fluid in the coelenteron creates a hydrostatic skeleton. Cnidarians have a simple nervous system consisting of a nerve net that can detect touch. They may also have other sensory structures. For example, jellyfish have light-sensing structures and gravity-sensing structures. These senses give them a sense of up versus down. It also helps them balance. 
Cnidarian  Reproduction 	  reproduction in polyps leads to the formation of new medusae. Medusae usually reproduce sexually. Sexual reproduction forms a zygote. The zygote develops into a larva called a planula. The planula, in turn, develops into a polyp. There are many variations on the general life cycle. Obviously, species that exist only as polyps or medusae have a life cycle without the other form. 
General  Cnidarian  Life  Cycle.  Cnidarians 	  may reproduce both asexually and sexually. 
Ecology of  Cnidarians 	  Cnidarians can be found in almost all ocean habitats. They may live in water that is shallow or deep, warm or cold. A few species live in freshwater. Some cnidarians live alone, while others live in colonies. Corals form large colonies in shallow tropical water. They are confined to shallow water because they have a mutualistic relationship with algae that live inside them. The algae need sunlight for photosynthesis, so they must be relatively close to the surface of the water. Corals exist only as polyps. They catch plankton with their tentacles. Many secrete a calcium carbonate exoskeleton. Over time, this builds up to become a coral reef (see Figure 11.18). Coral reefs provide food and shelter to many ocean organisms. They also help protect shorelines from erosion by absorbing some of the energy of waves. Coral reefs are at risk of destruction today. Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is a coral reef off the coast of Australia. Unlike corals, jellyfish spend most of their lives as medusae. They live virtually everywhere in the ocean. They are typically carnivores. They prey on zooplankton, other invertebrates, and the eggs and larvae of fish. 
Invertebrates 	  Jellyfish. They are otherworldly creatures that glow in the dark, without brains or bones, some more than 100 feet long. And there are many different types. Jellyfish are free-swimming members of the phylum Cnidaria. Jellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the deep sea.

They also have tentacles with stingers. • There are two cnidarian body plans: the polyp and the medusa. They differ in several ways. • Many corals secrete an exoskeleton that builds up to become a coral reef.

Would you believe that this gold-dotted creature is a flatworm? No? Well it is. There are more than 25,000 different types of flatworms, so they can be very different in how they appear. And many don’t even look like your typical worm. 
Flatworms 	  Flatworms belong to the phylum Platyhelminthes. Examples of flatworms are shown in Figure 11.19. There are more than 25,000 species in the flatworm phylum. See Heads, Tails and Brains at URL ife/episodes/hunter.html for an introduction to flatworms. 
Structure and  Function of  Flatworms 	  Flatworms range in length from about 1 millimeter (0.04 inches) to more than 20 meters (66 feet). They have a flat body because they do not have a coelom or even a pseudocoelom. They also lack a respiratory system. Instead, their cells exchange gases by diffusion directly with the environment. They have an incomplete digestive system. Flatworms reflect several major evolutionary advances in invertebrates. They have three embryonic cell layers, including mesoderm. The mesoderm layer allows them to develop organ systems. For example, they have muscular and excretory systems. The muscular system allows them to move from place to place over solid surfaces. The excretory system lets them maintain a proper balance of water and salts. Flatworms also show cephalization and bilateral symmetry. 
Platyhelminthes.  Platyhelminthes include 	  flatworms, tapeworms, and flukes. 
Flatworm  Reproduction 	  Flatworms reproduce sexually. In most species, the same individuals produce both eggs and sperm. After fertilization occurs, the fertilized eggs pass out of the adult’s body and hatch into larvae. There may be several different larval stages. The final larval stage develops into the adult form, and the life cycle repeats. 
Ecology of  Flatworms 	  Both flukes and tapeworms are parasites with vertebrate hosts, including human hosts. Flukes live in the host’s circulatory system or liver. Tapeworms live in the host’s digestive system. Usually, more than one type of host is required to complete the parasite’s life cycle. Look at the life cycle of the liver fluke in Figure 11.20. As an adult, the fluke has a vertebrate host. As a larva, it has an invertebrate host. If you follow the life cycle, you can see how each host becomes infected so the fluke can continue its life cycle. Tapeworms and flukes have suckers and other structures for feeding on a host. Tapeworms also have a scolex, a ring of hooks on their head to attach themselves to the host (see Figure 11.21). Unlike other invertebrates, tapeworms lack a mouth and digestive system. Instead, they absorb nutrients directly from the host’s digestive system with their suckers. Not all flatworms are parasites. Some are free-living carnivores. They eat other small invertebrates and decaying animals. Most of the free-living species live in aquatic habitats, but some live in moist soil. 
Summary 	  • Platyhelminthes are flatworms such as tapeworms and flukes. • Flatworms have a mesoderm cell layer and simple organ systems. They also show cephalization and bilateral symmetry. • Many flatworms are parasites with vertebrate hosts. Some are free-living carnivores that live mainly in aquatic habitats.

When most people picture a worm, do they picture a roundworm? Actually, they do not. Whereas flatworms are flat, roundworms obviously appear round. With over 80,000 species, there are plenty of different types of roundworms. But these are still not the types of worms most people picture when they think of worms. 
Roundworms 	  Roundworms make up the phylum Nematoda. This is a very diverse animal phyla. It has more than 80,000 known species. 
Structure and  Function of  Roundworms 	  Roundworms range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 7 meters (23 feet) in length. As their name suggests, they have a round body. This is because they have a pseudocoelom. This is one way they differ from flatworms. Another way is their complete digestive system. It allows them to take in food, digest food, and eliminate wastes all at the same time. Roundworms have a tough covering of cuticle on the surface of their body. It prevents their body from expanding. This allows the buildup of fluid pressure in the pseudocoelom. As a result, roundworms have a hydrostatic skeleton. This provides a counterforce for the contraction of muscles lining the pseudocoelom. This allows the worms to move efficiently along solid surfaces. 
Invertebrates 	  Roundworms reproduce sexually. Sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female adults. Fertilization takes place inside the female organism. Females lay huge numbers of eggs, sometimes as many as 100,000 per day! The eggs hatch into larvae, which develop into adults. Then the cycle repeats. 
Ecology of  Roundworms 	  Roundworms may be free-living or parasitic. Free-living worms are found mainly in freshwater habitats. Some live in soil. They generally feed on bacteria, fungi, protozoans, or decaying organic matter. By breaking down organic matter, they play an important role in the carbon cycle. Parasitic roundworms may have plant, vertebrate, or invertebrate hosts. Several species have human hosts. For example, hookworms, like the one in Figure 11.22, are human parasites. They infect the human intestine. They are named for the hooks they use to grab onto the host’s tissues. Hookworm larvae enter the host through the skin. They migrate to the intestine, where they mature into adults. Adults lay eggs, which pass out of the host in feces. Then the cycle repeats. 
Hookworm  Parasite.  Hookworms like this 	  one are common human parasites. Tiny pinworms are the most common roundworm parasites of people in the U.S. In some areas, as many as one out of three children are infected. Humans become infected when they ingest the nearly microscopic pinworm eggs. The eggs hatch and develop into adults in the host’s digestive tract. Adults lay eggs that pass out of the host’s body to continue the cycle. Pinworms have a fairly simple life cycle with only one host.

Fish or squid? Neither. This is a mollusk, a cuttlefish to be specific. What is a mollusk? Well, to start, mollusks are aquatic species that are not fish. There are over 100,000 different mollusks, so there are bound to be some interesting looking organisms, like this one. 
Mollusks 	  Have you ever been to the ocean or eaten seafood? If you have, then you probably have encountered members of the phylum Mollusca. Mollusks include snails, scallops, and squids, as shown in Figure 11.23. There are more than Race at URL for an introduction to mollusks. 
Structure and  Function of  Mollusks 	  Mollusks are a very diverse phylum. Some mollusks are nearly microscopic. The largest mollusk, a colossal squid, may be as long as a school bus and weigh over half a ton! The basic body plan of a mollusk is shown in Figure This figure shows some of the more common and familiar mollusks. organs. Most mollusks have a distinct head region. The head may have tentacles for sensing the environment and grasping food. There is generally a muscular foot, which may be used for walking. However, the foot has evolved modifications in many species to be used for other purposes. 
Basic  Mollusk  Body  Plan.  The basic body 	  plan shown here varies among mollusk classes. For example, several mollusk species no longer have shells. Do you know which ones? Two unique features of mollusks are the mantle and radula (see Figure 11.24). The mantle is a layer of tissue that lies between the shell and the body. It secretes calcium carbonate to form the shell. It forms a cavity, called the mantle cavity, between the mantle and the body. The mantle cavity pumps water for filter feeding. The radula is a feeding organ with teeth made of chitin. It is located in front of the mouth in the head region. Herbivorous mollusks use the radula to scrape food such as algae off rocks. Predatory mollusks use the radula to drill holes in the shells of their prey. Mollusks have a coelom and a complete digestive system. Their excretory system consists of tube-shaped organs called nephridia (see Figure 11.24). The organs filter waste from body fluids and release the waste into the coelom. Terrestrial mollusks exchange gases with the surrounding air. This occurs across the lining of the mantle cavity. Aquatic mollusks “breathe” under water with gills. Gills are thin filaments that absorb gases and exchange them between the blood and surrounding water. Mollusks have a circulatory system with one or two hearts that pump blood. The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the circulatory system when its muscles contract. The circulatory system may be open or closed, depending on the species. The major classes of mollusks vary in structure and function. You can read about some of their differences in Figure 
Invertebrates 	  Use this figure to compare and contrast gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods 
Mollusk  Reproduction 	  Mollusks reproduce sexually. Most species have separate male and female sexes. Gametes are released into the mantle cavity. Fertilization may be internal or external, depending on the species. Fertilized eggs develop into larvae. There may be one or more larval stages. Each one is different from the adult stage. Mollusks have a unique larval form called a trochophore. It is a tiny organism with cilia for swimming. 
Ecology of  Mollusks 	  Mollusks live in most terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats. However, the majority of species live in the ocean. They can be found in both shallow and deep water and from tropical to polar latitudes. Mollusks are a major food source for other organisms, including humans. You may have eaten mollusks such as clams, oysters, scallops, or mussels. The different classes of mollusks have different ways of obtaining food. • Gastropods may be herbivores, predators, or internal parasites. They live in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Marine species live mainly in shallow coastal waters. Gastropods use their foot to crawl slowly over rocks, reefs, or soil, looking for food. • Bivalves are generally sessile filter feeders. They live in both freshwater and marine habitats. They use their foot to attach themselves to rocks or reefs or to burrow into mud. Bivalves feed on plankton and nonliving organic matter. They filter the food out of the water as it flows through their mantle cavity. • Cephalopods are carnivores that live only in marine habitats. They may be found in the open ocean or close to shore. They are either predators or scavengers. They generally eat other invertebrates and fish. 
D:  Cool  Critters:  Dwarf  Cuttlefish 	  What’s the coolest critter in the ocean under 4 inches long? The Dwarf Cuttlefish! Cuttlefish are marine animals that belong to the class Cephalopoda. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but mollusks. Recent studies indicate that cuttlefish are among the most intelligent invertebrates, with one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates. Cuttlefish have an internal shell called the cuttlebone and eight arms and two tentacles furnished with suckers, with which they secure their prey.

D:  The  Fierce  Humboldt  Squid 	  The Humboldt squid is a large, predatory invertebrate found in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. A mysterious sea creature up to 7 feet long, with 10 arms, a sharp beak and a ravenous appetite, packs of fierce Humboldt Squid attack nearly everything they see, from fish to scuba divers. Traveling in groups of 1,000 or more and swimming at speeds of more than 15 miles an hour, these animals hunt and feed together, and use jet propulsion to shoot out of the water to escape predators. Humboldt squid live at depths of between 600 and about 2,000 feet, coming to the surface at night to feed. They live for approximately two years and spend much of their short life in the ocean’s oxygen-minimum zone, where very little other life exists. Because they live at such depths, little is known about these mysterious sea creatures. The Humboldt squid usually lives in the waters of the Humboldt Current, ranging from the southern tip of South America north to California, but in recent years, this squid has been found as far north as Alaska. Marine biologists are working to discover why they have headed north from their traditional homes off South America. See URL for additional information. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Invertebrates 	  • Summarize the characteristics of annelids. • Summarize the basic body plan of annelids. • Describe annelid external structures. • Distinguish between earthworms, polychaetes, and leeches. How can this be an animal? This is a worm. And even though it is blue, this is a Christmas tree worm. These "Christmas tree" structures are actually specialized mouth appendages. Each spiral is composed of feather-like tentacles which are heavily ciliated. These appendages trap prey and transport the food straight towards the worm’s mouth. And these worms are annelids. 
Annelids 	  The phylum Annelida is made up of segmented worms such as earthworms. Segmented worms are divided into many repeating segments. There are roughly 15,000 species of annelids. Most belong to one of three classes. A species in each class is pictured in Figure 11.26. See The Cambrian Explosion at URL ife/episodes/explosion.html for an introduction to annelids. 
Structure and  Function of  Annelids 	  Annelids range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 3 meters. They never attain the large size of some mollusks. Like mollusks, however, they have a coelom. In fact, the annelid coelom is even larger, allowing greater development of internal organs. Annelids have other similarities with mollusks, including: Classes of Annelids. The majority of annelids are polychaetes. They live on the ocean floor, so you may not be familiar with them. • A closed circulatory system (like cephalopods). • An excretory system consisting of tubular nephridia. • A complete digestive system. • A brain. • Sensory organs for detecting light and other stimuli. • Gills for gas exchange (but many exchange gas through their skin). The segmentation of annelids is highly adaptive. For one thing, it allows more efficient movement. Each segment generally has its own nerve and muscle tissues. Thus, localized muscle contractions can move just those segments needed for a particular motion. Segmentation also allows an animal to have specialized segments to carry out particular functions. This allows the whole animal to be more efficient. Annelids have the amazing capacity to regrow segments that break off. This is called regeneration. Annelids have a variety of structures on the surface of their body for movement and other functions. These vary, depending on the species. Several of the structures are described in Figure 11.27. 
Annelid  Reproduction 	  Most species of annelids can reproduce both asexually and sexually. However, leeches can reproduce only sexually. Asexual reproduction may occur by budding or fission. Sexual reproduction varies by species. • In some species, the same individual produces both sperm and eggs. But worms mate to exchange sperm, rather than self-fertilizing their own eggs. Fertilized eggs are deposited in a mucous cocoon. Offspring emerge from the cocoon looking like small adults. They grow to adult size without going through a larval stage. • In polychaete species, there are separate sexes. Adult worms go through a major transformation to develop reproductive organs. This occurs in many adults at once. Then they all swim to the surface and release their gametes in the water, where fertilization takes place. Offspring go through a larval stage before developing into adults. 
Invertebrates 	  Annelid External Structures. Many annelids have bristles and other types of external structures. Each structure is not present in all species. 
Ecology of  Annelids 	  Annelids live in a diversity of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats. They vary in what they feed on and how they obtain their food. • Earthworms are deposit feeders. They burrow through the ground, eating soil and extracting organic matter from it. Earthworm feces, called worm casts, are very rich in plant nutrients. Earthworm burrows help aerate soil, which is also good for plants. • Polychaetes live on the ocean floor. They may be sedentary filter feeders, active predators, or scavengers. Active species crawl along the ocean floor in search of food. • Leeches are either predators or parasites. As predators, they capture and eat other invertebrates. As parasites, they feed off the blood of vertebrate hosts. They have a tubular organ, called a proboscis, for feeding.

Invertebrates 	  • Give examples of arthropods. • Give an overview of the phylum Arthropoda. • List distinguishing features of arthropods. • Describe the arthropod exoskeleton and jointed appendages. • Describe arthropod classification. What has more species than any other animal phylum? Arthropods are not only the largest phylum of invertebrates. They are by far the largest phylum of the animal kingdom. Roughly 80 percent of all animal species living on Earth today are arthropods. Obviously, arthropods have been extremely successful. What accounts for their success? 
Arthropods 	  There are more than a million known species of arthropods. There may actually be ten times that many. Arthropods include insects, spiders, lobsters, and centipedes. The arthropods pictured in Figure 11.28 give just a hint of the phylum’s diversity. See From Water to Land at URL for an introduction to arthropods. 
Structure and  Function of  Arthropods 	  Arthropods range in length from about 1 millimeter to 4 meters (about 13 feet). They have a segmented body with a hard exoskeleton. They also have jointed appendages. The body segments are the head, thorax, and abdomen (see Arthropod Diversity. Dust mites are among the smallest of arthropods. Japanese spider crabs are the largest. Besides size, what other differences among arthropods do you see in these photos? The arthropod exoskeleton consists of several layers of cuticle. The exoskeleton prevents water loss and gives support and protection. It also acts as a counterforce for the contraction of muscles. The exoskeleton doesn’t grow as the animal grows. Therefore, it must be shed and replaced with a new one periodically through life. This is called molting. The jointed appendages of arthropods may be used as legs for walking. Being jointed makes them more flexible. Try walking or climbing stairs without bending your knees, and you’ll see why joints are helpful. In most arthropods, the appendages on the head have been modified for other functions. Figure 11.30 shows some of head appendages found in arthropods. Sensory organs such as eyes are also found on the head. Some arthropods have special excretory structures. They are called coxal glands and Malpighian tubules. Coxal glands collect and concentrate liquid waste from blood. They excrete the waste from the body through a pore. Malphigian tubules carry waste from the digestive tract to the anus. The waste is excreted through the anus. Like mollusks and annelids, aquatic arthropods may have gills to exchange gases with the water (discussed below). Terrestrial arthropods, on the other hand, have special respiratory structures to exchange gases with the air. These are described in Figure 11.31. 
Underwater  Spiders 	  In the ponds of northern Europe lives a tiny brown spider that spends its entire life underwater. But just like land spiders, it needs oxygen to breathe. So, how does this spider breath? Does it use book lungs? No. In fact, aquatic

Arthropods have 	  evolved a variety of specialized appendages and other structures on their head. How Terrestrial Arthropods Breathe Air. 
Terrestrial arthropods have respiratory 	  structures that let them breathe air. spiders, known as "diving bell spiders," have gills. Every so often, the spider leaves its underwater web to visit the surface and bring back a bubble of air that sticks to its hairy abdomen. It deposits the bubble into a little silk air tank. This "diving bell" is a gill that sucks oxygen from the water, allowing the spider to stay underwater for up to additional pictures. URL shows these spiders in action. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Arthropod  Reproduction 	  Arthropods have a life cycle with sexual reproduction. Most species go through larval stages after hatching. The larvae are very different from the adults. They change into the adult form in a process called metamorphosis. This may take place within a cocoon. A familiar example of metamorphosis is the transformation of a caterpillar (larva) into a butterfly (adult). Other arthropod species, in contrast, hatch young that look like small adults. These species 
Invertebrates 	  lack both larval stages and metamorphosis. 
Evolution of  Arthropods 	  The oldest known arthropods are trilobites. A fossil trilobite is shown in Figure 11.32. Trilobites were marine arthropods. They had many segments with paired appendages for walking. As arthropods continued to evolve, segments fused. Eventually, arthropods with three major segments evolved. Appendages were also lost or modified during the course of arthropod evolution. Trilobite Fossil. This trilobite fossil represents the earliest arthropods. Trilobites first appeared more than 500 million years ago. They lived for at least 200 million years before going extinct. They left behind large numbers of fossils. Arthropods were the first animals to live on land. The earliest terrestrial arthropods were probably millipedes. They moved to land about 430 million years ago. Early land arthropods evolved adaptations such as book lungs or trachea to breathe air. The exoskeleton was another important adaptation. It prevents an animal from drying out. It also provides support in the absence of buoyant water. 
Classification of  Arthropods 	  Living arthropods are divided into four subphyla. They are described in Table 11.3. The Hexapoda subphylum includes mainly insects. There are so many insects and they are so important that they are described in greater detail below.

Invertebrates 	  • Outline the characteristics and importance of insects. • Describe insect flight. • Outline the insect life cycle. • Give examples of insect behavior. What dominates life on Earth? Well, by numbers, it’s not humans. This may look like a scary creature from your worst nightmare, but it wouldn’t hurt a fly. In fact, it is a fly! The picture shows the charming portrait of a horsefly, up close and personal. Those big, striped, colorful orbs are its eyes. Did you ever look through a kaleidoscope? If so, then you have an idea of what the world looks like to a horsefly. What other organs do insects like this horsefly have? Besides sensing their environment, what other functions do their organs serve? 
Insects 	  Most members of the subphylum Hexapoda are insects (class Insecta). 
In fact, more than half of all known 	  organisms are insects. There may be more than 10 million insect species in the world, most of them yet to be identified. It’s clear that insects, and not humans, dominate life on Earth. 
Structure and  Function of  Insects 	  Insects range in length from less than a millimeter to about the length of your arm. They can be found in most habitats, but they are mainly terrestrial. Many can fly, so they are also aerial. Like other arthropods, insects have a 
Hexapoda.  A cricket on green leaf.  Can 	  you find the six legs attached to the thorax? head, thorax, and abdomen. They have a wide variety of appendages, including six legs attached to the thorax. Insects have a pair of antennae for “smelling” and “tasting” chemicals. Some insects can also use their antennae to detect sound. Other sensory organs on the head include several simple eyes and a pair of compound eyes. The compound eyes let insects see images. Butterflies and bees can even see in color. For feeding, the head contains one pair of mandibles and two pairs of maxillae. Insects consume a wide range of foods, and their mouthparts have become specialized. Several variations are shown in Figure 11.34. An insect’s abdomen contains most of the internal organs. Like other arthropods, insects have a complete digestive system. They also have an open circulatory system and central nervous system. Like other terrestrial arthropods, they have trachea for breathing air and Malpighian tubules for excretion. 
Insect  Flight 	  The main reason that insects have been so successful is their ability to fly. Insects are the only invertebrates that can fly and were the first animals to evolve flight. Flight has important advantages. It’s a guaranteed means of escape from nonflying predators. It also aids in the search for food and mates. Insects generally have two pairs of wings for flight. Wings are part of the exoskeleton and attached to the thorax. Insect wings show a lot of variation. As you can see in Figure 11.35, butterfly wings are paper-thin, whereas beetle wings are like armor. Not all insect wings work the same way, either. They differ in how the muscles are attached and whether the two pairs of wings work independently or together. Besides flight, wings serve other functions. They may protect the body (beetles), communicate visually with other insects (butterflies), or produce sounds to attract mates (katydids). 
Insect  Reproduction 	  Nearly all insects reproduce sexually. Some can also reproduce asexually. An example of an insect life cycle is shown in Figure 11.36. When an insect egg hatches, a larva emerges. The larva eats and grows and then enters the pupa stage. The pupa is immobile and may be encased in a cocoon. During the pupa stage, the insect goes through metamorphosis. 
Mouthpart  Specialization in  Insects.  The 	  mouthparts of insects are adapted for different food sources. How do you think the different mouthparts evolved? Tissues and appendages of the larva break down and reorganize into the adult form. How did such an incredible transformation evolve? Metamorphosis is actually very advantageous. It allows functions to be divided between life stages. Each stage can evolve adaptations to suit it for its specific functions without affecting the adaptations of the other stage. 
Insect  Behavior 	  Insects are capable of a surprising range of behaviors. Most of their behaviors, such as flying and mating, are instinctive. These are behaviors that don’t need to be learned. They are largely controlled by genes. However, some insect behaviors are learned. For example, ants and bees can learn where food is located and keep going back for more. Many species of insects have evolved complex social behaviors. They live together in large, organized colonies (see Figure 11.37). This is true of ants, termites, bees, and wasps. Colonies may include millions of individual insects. Colony members divide up the labor of the colony. Different insects are specialized for different jobs. Some reproduce, while others care for the young. Still others get food or defend the nest. Form and Function in Insect Wings. Beetles, butterflies, and katydids all have two pairs of wings that they use for flight. However, the wings are very different because they have other functions as well. Insect Life Cycle. This diagram represents the life cycle of a mosquito. Most insects have a similar life cycle. Living in a large colony requires good communication. Ants communicate with chemicals called pheromones. For example, an ant deposits pheromones on the ground as it returns to the nest from a food source. It is marking the path so other ants can find the food. Honeybees communicate by doing a “waggle dance.” 
Termite  Nest.  This cathedral-like structure 	  is the nest of a huge colony of termites in Australia. 
In fact, it is the world’s largest 	  known termite nest. It towers 7.5 meters (25 feet) above the ground and houses millions of termites.

D:  Ladybugs:  A  Population of  Millions 	  Ladybugs, also known as ladybird beetles, have a life cycle of four to six weeks. 
In one year as many as six 	  generations of ladybird beetles may hatch. In the spring, each adult female lays up to 300 eggs in small clusters on plants where aphids are present. After a week the wingless larvae hatch. Both the ladybird beetle larvae and adults are active predators, eating only aphids, scales, mites and other plant-eating insects. The ladybugs live on the vegetation where their prey is found, which includes roses, oleander, milkweed and broccoli. Adult ladybugs don’t taste very good. A bird careless enough to try to eat one will not swallow it. By late May to early June, when the larvae have depleted the food supply, the adults migrate to the mountains. There, they eat mainly pollen. The ladybugs gain fat from eating the pollen and this tides them over during their nine-month hibernation. Thousands of adults hibernate overwinter in tight clusters, called aggregates, under fallen leaves and ground litter near streams. In the clear, warmer days of early spring, the ladybugs break up the aggregates and begin several days of mating. Learn about ladybugs at URL . 
Insects and  Humans 	  Most humans interact with insects every day. Many of these interactions are harmless and often go unnoticed. However, insects cause humans a lot of harm. They spread human diseases. For example, the deadly bubonic plague of the middle ages was spread by fleas. Today, millions of people die each year from malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes. Insects also eat our crops. Sometimes they travel in huge swarms that completely strip the land of all plant material (see Figure 11.38). On the other hand, we depend on insects for the very food we eat. Without insects to pollinate them, flowering plants—including many food crops—could not reproduce. 
African country of  Mauritania darkens the 	  mid-day sky. The hungry insects will eat virtually all the plants in their path. 
D:  Better  Bees:  Super  Bee and  Wild  Bee 	  Honeybees are one of the most well-known insects on the planet. Bees are naturalized on every continent except Antarctica. Honeybees have a highly developed social structure and depend on their community, or colony, for survival, with a colony containing up to 20,000 bees. When bees search plants for nectar, pollen sticks to the fuzzy hairs that cover their hind legs. At the next flower, some of the pollen rubs off and fertilizes that flower. In this way, bees help improve fruit production. Bees pollinate an estimated 130 different varieties of fruit, flowers, nuts and vegetables in the United States alone. Farmers obviously depend on bees to pollinate crops, such as fruit and nuts, but in recent years thousands of bee colonies have disappeared. This could be a devastating issue for farmers. Can anything be done? Meet two Northern California researchers looking for ways to make sure we always have bees to pollinate crops at URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Believe it or not, this is an animal. See the mouth and arms? It is a sea lily, a crinoid echinoderm. Crinoids are essentially a mouth on the top surface that is surrounded by feeding arms. Although the basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognized, most crinoids have many more than five arms. Crinoids usually have a stem used to attach themselves to a surface, but many become free-swimming as adults. 
Echinoderms 	  Echinoderms are marine organisms that make up the phylum Echinodermata. They can be found in the ocean from the equator to the poles. There are roughly 6000 living species of echinoderms. They are among the most distinctive organisms within the animal kingdom. Members of the phylum include sea stars (starfish), sand dollars, and feather stars, shown in Figure 11.39. See “Different But Equal” at URL ml for an introduction to echinoderms. 
Structure and  Function of  Echinoderms 	  Echinoderms are named for their “spiny skin.” However, the spines aren’t on their skin. They are part of the endoskeleton. The endoskeleton consists of calcium carbonate plates and spines, covered by a thin layer of skin. Adult echinoderms have radial symmetry. This is easy to see in the sea star and sand dollar in Figure 11.39. 
Invertebrates 	  Examples of Echinoderms. You may have seen sea stars and sand dollars at the beach because they live in shallow water near the shore. Other echinoderms, such as feather stars, are less commonly seen because they live in the deep ocean. However, echinoderms evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry. Evidence for this is the bilateral symmetry of their larvae. A unique feature of echinoderms is their water vascular system. This is a network of canals that extend along each body part. In most echinoderms, the canals have external projections called tube feet (see Figure 11.40). The feet have suckers on the ends. Muscle contractions force water into the feet, causing them to extend outward. As the feet extend, they attach their suckers to new locations, farther away from their previous points of attachment. This results in a slow but powerful form of movement. The suckers are very strong. They can even be used to pry open the shells of prey. Echinoderms lack respiratory and excretory systems. Instead, the thin walls of their tube feet allow oxygen to diffuse in and wastes to diffuse out. Echinoderms also lack a centralized nervous system. They have an open circulatory system and lack a heart. On the other hand, echinoderms have a well-developed coelom and a complete digestive system. Echinoderms use pheromones to communicate with each other. They detect the chemicals with sensory cells on their body surface. Some echinoderms also have simple eyes ( ocelli) that can sense light. Like annelids, echinoderms have the ability to regenerate a missing body part. 
Echinoderm  Reproduction 	  Some echinoderms can reproduce asexually by fission, but most echinoderms reproduce sexually. They generally have separate sexes and external fertilization. Eggs hatch into free-swimming larvae. The larvae undergo metamorphosis to change into the adult form. During metamorphosis, their bilateral symmetry changes to radial symmetry. 
Tube  Feet of a  Sea  Star.  The tube feet of 	  a sea star (in white) are part of its water vascular system. There is a sucker on the end of each foot that allows the animal to “walk” slowly over a surface. The suckers are strong enough to pry open shells. 
Echinoderm  Classification 	  Living echinoderms are placed in five classes. These five classes show many similarities. Organisms in each class are described in Table 11.4.

Summary 	  • Echinoderms are marine invertebrates. They include sea stars, sand dollars, and feather stars. • Echinoderms have a spiny endoskeleton. They have radial symmetry as adults but bilateral symmetry as larvae. • Echinoderms have a unique water vascular system with tube feet. This allows slow but powerful movement.

Would you believe this animal eats its own brain? This is a sea squirt, which is a tunicate. Many physical changes occur to the tunicate’s body during metamorphosis into an adult, with one of the most interesting being the digestion of the cerebral ganglion, which controls movement and is the equivalent of the human brain. From this comes the common saying that the sea squirt "eats its own brain." 
Invertebrate  Chordates 	  Living species of chordates are classified into three major subphyla: Vertebrata, Urochordata, and Cephalochordata. Vertebrates are all chordates that have a backbone. The other two subphyla are invertebrate chordates that lack a backbone. Members of the subphylum Urochordata are tunicates (also called sea squirts). Members of the subphylum Cephalochordata are lancelets. Both tunicates and lancelets are small and primitive. They are probably similar to the earliest chordates that evolved more than 500 million years ago. 
Tunicates 	  There are about 3,000 living species of tunicates (see Figure 11.41). They inhabit shallow marine waters. Larval tunicates are free-swimming. They have all four defining chordate traits (see the "Chordates" concept). Adult tunicates are sessile. They no longer have a notochord or post-anal tail. 
Tunicates ( Urochordata).  Tunicates are 	  one of two subphyla of invertebrate chordates. Adult tunicates are barrel-shaped. They have two openings that siphon water into and out of the body. The flow of water provides food for filter feeding. Tunicates reproduce sexually. Each individual produces both male and female gametes. However, they avoid self-fertilization. Tunicates can also reproduce asexually by budding. 
Lancelets 	  There are only about 25 living species of lancelets. They inhabit the ocean floor where the water is shallow. Lancelet larvae are free-swimming. The adults can swim but spend most of their time buried in the sand. Like tunicates, lancelets are filter feeders. They take in water through their mouth and expel it through an opening called the atriopore (see Figure 11.42). Lancelets reproduce sexually and have separates sexes. Lancelet (Cephalochordata). Unlike tunicates, lancelets retain all four defining chordate traits in the adult stage. Can you find them? 
Summary 	  • Chordates include vertebrates and invertebrates that have a notochord. • Invertebrate chordates do not have a backbone. • Invertebrate chordates include tunicates and lancelets. Both are primitive marine organisms. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Invertebrate members of the Phylum Chordata at URL . 
Summary 	  Invertebrates describes eight invertebrate phyla with the greatest number of species. From the simple sponge to the echinodermata, this diverse group of organisms is anything but simple. Essentially, the only common characteristic among all the groups is the lack of a backbone. Many people may not even recognize the sponge as an animal. But it is. And how many people think a worm is an insect? But it is not. Add to this group all the different species of insects, and the diverseness of this group is easily apparent.

Introduction 	  What do all animals from fish to mammals have in common? Vertebrates. From the smallest of fish to us. One of the main features we all have in common is our backbone. The Vertebrates chapter describes the biological features of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. • Define chordate. • Give examples of chordates. • Outline the characteristics of chordates. • Describe chordate classification. What’s a chordate? Most chordates are animals with backbones. These range from small fish to giant whales, from playful dogs to ferocious cats. Not nearly as diverse as the invertebrates. But chordates do have many amazing species. The white tiger (Panthera tigris) is a chordate. The tiger is also from the class Mammalia, order Carnivora, and family Felidae, meaning it is a meat-eating cat. 
Introduction to  Chordates 	  The phylum Chordata consists of both invertebrate and vertebrate chordates. It is a large and diverse phylum. It includes some 60,000 species. Chordates range in length from about a centimeter to over 30 meters (100 feet). They live in marine, freshwater, terrestrial, and aerial habitats. They can be found from the equator to the poles. Several examples of chordates are pictured in Figure 12.1. 
Characteristics of  Chordates 	  Chordates have three embryonic cell layers. They also have a segmented body with a coelom and bilateral symmetry. Chordates have a complete digestive system and a closed circulatory system. Their nervous system is centralized. There are four additional traits that are unique to chordates. These four traits, shown in Figure 12.2, define the chordate phylum. 
Diversity of  Chordates.  These six species 	  illustrate the diversity of the phylum Chordata. animals, the nerve cord is solid and runs along the bottom). counterbalance the pull of muscles. the digestive and respiratory tracts. In some chordates, all four traits persist throughout life and serve important functions. However, in many chordates, including humans, all four traits are present only during the embryonic stage. After that, some of the traits disappear or develop into other organs. For example, in humans, pharyngeal slits are present in embryos and later develop into the middle ear. 
Body  Plan of a  Typical  Chordate.  The 	  body plan of a chordate includes a postanal tail, notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits. 
Classification of  Chordates 	  Living species of chordates are classified into three major subphyla: Vertebrata, Urochordata, and Cephalochordata. Vertebrates are all chordates that have a backbone. The other two subphyla are invertebrate chordates that lack a backbone. 
Summary 	  • Chordates include vertebrates and invertebrates that have a notochord. • Chordates also have a post-anal tail, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits. • Vertebrate chordates have a backbone. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • The Biology of Chordates at URL . phylum? • Describe the vertebrate endoskeleton. • Summarize the general characteristics of vertebrates. What traits set this animal apart from invertebrate chordates? This small colorful fish is a vertebrate it has a backbone. And vertebral columns first evolved in fish. Think about the invertebrate chordates. They live in the ocean, so it only makes sense that fish would be the first true vertebrates. Vertebrates are a subphylum of the phylum Chordata. Like all chordates, vertebrates have a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. What other characteristics do vertebrates have? 
Characteristics of  Vertebrates 	  The main distinguishing feature of vertebrates is their vertebral column, or backbone (see Figure 12.3). The backbone runs from the head to the tail along the dorsal (top) side of the body. The vertebral column is the core of the endoskeleton. It allows a vertebrate to hold its shape. It also houses and protects the spinal (nerve) cord that passes through it. The vertebral column is made up of repeating units called vertebrae (singular, vertebra). In many species, there are shock-absorbing discs between the vertebrae to cushion them during movement. See Vertebrates at URL for additional information. 
Vertebrate  Endoskeleton 	  Another distinguishing feature of vertebrates is an endoskeleton made of bone or cartilage. Cartilage is a tough tissue that contains a protein called collagen. Bone is a hard tissue that consists of a collagen matrix, or framework, filled in with minerals such as calcium. Bone is less flexible than cartilage but stronger. An endoskeleton made of Human Vertebral Column and Vertebrae. 
The human vertebral column consists of 	  here enlarged. bone rather than cartilage allows animals to grow larger and heavier. Bone also provides more protection for soft tissues and internal organs. As shown in Figure 12.4, the vertebrate endoskeleton includes a cranium, or skull, to enclose and protect the brain. It also generally includes two pairs of limbs. Limb girdles (such as the human hips and shoulders) connect the limbs to the rest of the endoskeleton. Vertebrate Endoskeletons. The vertebrate endoskeleton includes a vertebral column, cranium, limbs, and limb girdles. Can you find these parts in each endoskeleton shown here? 
Other  Vertebrate  Traits 	  There are several additional traits found in virtually all vertebrates. • Vertebrates have a system of muscles attached to the endoskeleton to enable movement. Muscles control movement by alternately contracting (shortening) and relaxing (lengthening). Generally, muscles work together in opposing pairs. • Vertebrates have a closed circulatory system with a heart. Blood is completely contained within blood vessels that carry the blood throughout the body. The heart is divided into chambers that work together to pump blood. There are between two and four chambers in the vertebrate heart. With more chambers, there is more oxygen in the blood and more vigorous pumping action. • Most vertebrates have skin covered with scales, feathers, fur, or hair. These features serve a variety of functions, such as waterproofing and insulating the body. • Vertebrates have an excretory system that includes a pair of kidneys. Kidneys are organs that filter wastes from blood so they can be excreted from the body. • Vertebrates have an endocrine system of glands that secrete hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that control many body functions. • Vertebrates have an adaptive immune system. The immune system is the organ system that defends the body from pathogens and other causes of disease. Being adaptive means that the immune system can "learn" to recognize specific pathogens. Then it can produce tailor-made proteins called antibodies to "attack" them. This allows the immune system to launch a rapid attack whenever the pathogens invade the body again. • Vertebrates have a centralized nervous system. As shown in Figure 12.5, the nervous system consists of a brain in the head region. It also includes a long spinal cord that runs from the brain to the tail end of the backbone. Long nerve fibers extend from the spinal cord to muscles and organs throughout the body. Nervous System (Human). The vertebrate nervous system includes a brain and spinal cord. It also includes a bodywide network of nerves, called peripheral nerves. They connect the spinal cord with the rest of the body. 
Summary 	  • Vertebrates are a subphylum of chordates that have a vertebral column and an endoskeleton made of cartilage or bone. • Vertebrates also have complex organ systems, including a closed circulatory system with a heart, an excretory system with a pair of kidneys, and an adaptive immune system. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Characteristics of the Five Vertebrate Groups at URL . endoskeleton. • Explain how vertebrates reproduce. • Distinguish between ovipary, ovovivipary, and vivipary. Does the embryo develop in the mother or in an egg? Is the egg within the mother or not? Vertebrate reproduction occurs by one of three methods. These bird eggs demonstrate one of three types of vertebrate reproduction. 
Vertebrate  Reproduction 	  Vertebrates reproduce sexually, and almost all of them have separate male and female sexes. Recall that sexual reproduction is the joining of gametes during fertilization, producing genetically variable offspring. Generally, aquatic species have external fertilization, whereas terrestrial species have internal fertilization. Can you think of a reason why aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates differ in this way? Vertebrates have one of the following three reproductive strategies: ovipary, ovovivipary, or vivipary. • Ovipary refers to the development of an embryo within an egg outside the mother’s body. This occurs in most amphibians and reptiles and in all birds. • Ovovivipary refers to the development of an embryo inside an egg within the mother’s body until it hatches. The mother provides no nourishment to the developing embryo inside the egg. This occurs in some species of fish and reptiles. • Vivipary refers to the development and nourishment of an embryo within the mother’s body. Birth may be followed by a period of parental care of the offspring. This reproductive strategy occurs in almost all mammals. What type of reproduction occurs in kangaroos? 
Summary 	  • Vertebrates reproduce sexually, and almost all have separate male and female sexes. • Aquatic species generally have external fertilization, whereas terrestrial species usually have internal fertilization. • Vertebrates have one of three reproductive strategies, known as ovipary, ovovivipary, or vivipary. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Reproduction in Vertebrates at URL . • Summarize vertebrate classification. • Identify the nine classes of vertebrates. • Give examples of each class of vertebrate. The stingray. Fish? Of course. But what type? Of the nine classes of vertebrates, five are fish. Each of the five classes has distinguishing characteristics that allow members to be classified appropriately. Stingray are cartilaginous fish, related to sharks. 
Vertebrate  Classification 	  There are about 50,000 vertebrate species, and they are placed in nine different classes. Five of the classes are fish. The other classes are amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Table 12.1 lists some of the distinguishing traits of each class. Classes are listed in order of evolution.

Summary 	  • The 50,000 species of living vertebrates are placed in nine classes: hagfish, lampreys, cartilaginous fish, rayfinned fish, lobe-finned fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Classes of Vertebrates at URL . • Give an overview of vertebrate evolution. • Describe the evolutionary importance of the amniotic egg. • Distinguish ectothermy from endothermy. What type of fish is a simple perch? Does it have a partial of complete vertebral column? What about a jaw? Do you think the endoskeleton is made of cartilage or bone? Why are these important evolutionary steps? A bony skeletal could support a larger body. Early bony fish evolved into modern ray-finned and lobe-finned fish, which then evolved into species that could move out of the water. 
Vertebrate  Evolution 	  The earliest vertebrates were jawless fish, similar to living hagfish. They lived between 500 and 600 million years ago. They had a cranium but no vertebral column. The phylogenetic tree in Figure 12.7 gives an overview of vertebrate evolution. As more data become available, new ideas about vertebrate evolution emerge. 
Evolution of  Fish 	  Not too long after hagfish first appeared, fish similar to lampreys evolved a partial vertebral column. The first fish with a complete vertebral column evolved about 450 million years ago. These fish also had jaws and may have been similar to living sharks. Up to this point, all early vertebrates had an endoskeleton made of cartilage rather than bone. About 400 million years ago, the first bony fish appeared. A bony skeleton could support a larger body. Early bony fish evolved into modern ray-finned and lobe-finned fish. Phylogenetic Tree of Vertebrate Evolution. 
The earliest vertebrates evolved almost 	  vertebrates evolved last? 
Evolution of  Other  Vertebrate  Classes 	  Amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds evolved after fish. • The first amphibians evolved from a lobe-finned fish ancestor about 365 million years ago. They were the first vertebrates to live on land, but they had to return to water to reproduce. This meant they had to live near bodies of water. • The first reptiles evolved from an amphibian ancestor at least 300 million years ago. They laid amniotic eggs and had internal fertilization. They were the first vertebrates that no longer had to return to water to reproduce. They could live just about anywhere. • Mammals and birds both evolved from reptile-like ancestors. The first mammals appeared about 200 million years ago and the earliest birds about 150 million years ago. 
Evolution of  Endothermy 	  Until mammals and birds evolved, all vertebrates were ectothermic. Ectothermy means regulating body temperature from the outside through behavioral changes. For example, an ectotherm might stay under a rock in the shade in order to keep cool on a hot, sunny day. Almost all living fish, amphibians, and reptiles are ectothermic. Their metabolic rate and level of activity depend mainly on the outside temperature. They can raise or lower their own temperature only slightly through behavior alone. Both mammals and birds evolved endothermy. Endothermy means regulating body temperature from the inside through metabolic or other physical changes. On a cold day, for example, an endotherm may produce more heat by raising its metabolic rate. On a hot day, it may give off more heat by increasing blood flow to the surface of the body. Keeping body temperature stable allows cells to function at peak efficiency at all times. The metabolic rate and activity level can also remain high regardless of the outside temperature. On the other hand, maintaining a stable body temperature requires more energy—and more food. 
Summary 	  • The earliest vertebrates resembled hagfish and lived more than 500 million years ago. • As other classes of fish appeared, they evolved traits such as a complete vertebral column, jaws, and a bony endoskeleton. • Amphibians were the first tetrapod vertebrates as well as the first vertebrates to live on land. • Reptiles were the first amniotic vertebrates. • Mammals and birds, which both descended from reptile-like ancestors, evolved endothermy, or the ability to regulate body temperature from the inside.

What are these geometric shapes? These are the scales the skin of a blue Siamese fighting fish, and they almost look like a piece of art. They also look like they form a smooth, streamlined skin. Why is this important to a fish? 
Structure and  Function in  Fish 	  Fish are aquatic vertebrates. They make up more than half of all vertebrate species. They are especially important in the study of vertebrate evolution because several important vertebrate traits evolved in fish. Fish show great diversity in body size. They range in length from about 8 millimeters (0.3 inches) to 16 meters (about 53 feet). Most are ectothermic and covered with scales. Scales protect fish from predators and parasites and reduce friction with the water. Multiple, overlapping scales provide a flexible covering that allows fish to move easily while swimming. 
Adaptations for  Water 	  Many structures in fish are adaptations for their aquatic lifestyle. Several are described below and shown in Figure • Fish have gills that allow them to “breathe” oxygen in water. Water enters the mouth, passes over the gills, and exits the body through a special opening. Gills absorb oxygen from the water as it passes over them. • Fish have a stream-lined body. They are typically long and narrow, which reduces water resistance when they swim. • Most fish have several fins for swimming. They use some of their fins to propel themselves through the water and others to steer the body as they swim. • Fish have a system of muscles for movement. Muscle contractions ripple through the body in waves from head to tail. The contractions whip the tail fin against the water to propel the fish through the water. • Most fish have a swim bladder. This is a balloon-like internal organ that contains gas. By changing the amount of gas in the bladder, a fish can move up or down through the water column. General Fish Body Plan. A fish has a stream-lined body with gills and fins. 
Fish  Organ  Systems 	  Fish have a circulatory system with a two-chambered heart. Their digestive system is complete and includes several organs and glands. Jawed fish use their jaws and teeth to grind up food before passing it to the rest of the digestive tract. This allows them to consume larger prey. Fish also have a centralized nervous system with a brain. Fish brains are small compared with the brains of other vertebrates, but they are large and complex compared with the brains of invertebrates. Fish also have highly developed sense organs that allow them to see, hear, feel, smell, and taste. Sharks and some other fish can even sense the very low levels of electricity emitted by other animals. This helps them locate prey. 
Summary 	  • Fish are aquatic, ectothermic vertebrates. • Many structures in fish are adaptations for their aquatic lifestyle. For example, fish have a stream-lined body that reduces water resistance while swimming. • Fish have gills for “breathing” oxygen in water and fins for propelling and steering their body through water.

Wild male and female Sockeye salmon before spawning. Sockeye salmon are blue tinged with silver in color while living in the ocean. Just prior to spawning, both sexes turn red with green heads. Sockeye spawn mostly in streams having lakes in their watershed. The young fish spend up to three years in the freshwater lake before migrating to the ocean. Migratory fish spend from one to four years in salt water, and thus are four to six years old when they return to spawn. Navigation to the home river is thought to be done using the characteristic smell of the stream, and possibly the sun. 
Fish  Reproduction and  Development 	  Nearly all fish reproduce sexually, and most species have separate sexes. Those without separate sexes avoid selffertilization by producing sperm and eggs at different times. Each fish typically produces a large number of gametes. In most fish species, fertilization takes place externally. These fish are oviparous. Eggs are laid and embryos develop outside the mother’s body. In a minority of fish, including sharks, eggs develop inside the mother’s body but without nourishment from the mother. These fish are ovoviviparous. 
Spawning 	  In many species of fish, a large group of adults come together to release their gametes into the water at the same time. This is called spawning. It increases the chances that fertilization will take place. It also means that many embryos will form at once, which helps ensure that at least some of them will be able to escape predators. With spawning, there is no way for fish parents to know which embryos are their own. Therefore, fish generally don’t provide any care to their eggs or offspring. There are some exceptions, however, including the fish described in Figure 12.9, which is performing mouth brooding. 
Mouth  Brooding.  Some species of fish 	  carry their fertilized eggs in their mouth until they hatch. This is called mouth 
If you look closely, you can 	  brooding. see the eggs inside the mouth of the cardinalfish pictured here. 
Fish  Larvae 	  Fish eggs hatch into larvae that are different from the adult form of the species (see Figure 12.10). A larva swims attached to a large yolk sac, which provides the larva with food. The larva eventually goes through metamorphosis and changes into the adult form. However, it still needs to mature before it can reproduce.

Many adults of the same species may come together in a group and release gametes into the water at the same time, which is called spawning. • Fish hatch into larvae that are different from the adult form of the species.

What type of animal is a sea horse? Is it actually a fish? It is, and there are about 50 species of seahorses. Although they are bony fish, they do not have scales, but rather a thin skin stretched over a series of bony plates arranged in rings throughout their body. Each species has a distinct number of rings. Seahorses have a coronet on their head, which is distinct to each individual, much like a human fingerprint. Seahorses also swim upright, a characteristic not shared by other fish. Seahorses are poor swimmers, so they are most likely to be found resting, with their prehensile tails wound around a stationary object. They have long snouts, which they use to suck up food, and eyes that can move independently of each other. Seahorses eat small shrimp, tiny fish, crustaceans, and plankton. 
Classification of  Fish 	  There are about 28,000 existing species of fish, and they are placed in five different classes. The classes are commonly referred to as hagfish, lampreys, cartilaginous fish, ray-finned fish, and lobe-finned fish (see the table in the previous lesson). 
Hagfish 	  Hagfish are very primitive fish. They retain their notochord throughout life rather than developing a backbone, and they lack scales and fins. They are classified as vertebrates mainly because they have a cranium. Hagfish are noted for secreting large amounts of thick, slimy mucus. The mucus makes them slippery, so they can slip out of the jaws of predators. 
Lampreys 	  Like hagfish, lampreys also lack scales, but they have fins and a partial backbone. The most striking feature of lampreys is a large round sucker, lined with teeth, that surrounds the mouth (see Figure 12.11). Lampreys use their sucker to feed on the blood of other fish species. 
Sucker  Mouth of a  Lamprey.  The mouth of 	  a lamprey is surrounded by a tooth-lined sucker. 
Cartilaginous  Fish 	  Cartilaginous fish include sharks, rays, and ratfish (see Figure 12.12). In addition to an endoskeleton composed of cartilage, these fish have a complete backbone. They also have a relatively large brain. They can solve problems and interact with other members of their species. They are generally predators with keen senses. Cartilaginous fish lack a swim bladder. Instead, they stay afloat by using a pair of muscular fins to push down against the water and create lift. One of the most important traits of cartilaginous fish is their jaws. Jaws allow them to bite food and break it into smaller pieces. This is a big adaptive advantage because it greatly expands the range of food sources they can consume. Jaws also make cartilaginous fish excellent predators. It you’ve ever seen the film Jaws, then you know that jaws make sharks very fierce predators (see also Figure 12.13). 
Ray- Finned  Fish 	  Ray-finned fish include the majority of living fish species, including goldfish, tuna, salmon, perch, and cod. They have a bony endoskeleton and a swim bladder. Their thin fins consist of webs of skin over flexible bony rays, or spines. The fins lack muscle, so their movements are controlled by muscles in the body wall. You can compare their ray fins with the fleshy fins of lobe-finned fish in Figure 12.14. 
Lobe- Finned  Fish 	  Lobe-finned fish are currently far fewer in number than ray-finned fish. Their fins, like the one shown in Figure coelacanths and lungfish. Cartilaginous Fish. All of these fish belong to the class of cartilaginous fish with jaws. (a) Oceanic whitetip shark (b) Ray (c) Ratfish small numbers. them to survive for long periods out of water. 
Jaws of a  Shark.  Sharks have powerful 	  jaws with multiple rows of sharp, saw-like teeth. Most other fish are no match for these powerful predators. Fins of Bony Fish. The fins of ray-finned and lobe-finned fish are quite different. How is the form of the fins related to their different functions in the two classes of fish? Ray Fin (left), Lobe Fin (right) 
Summary 	  • There are about 28,000 existing species of fish, and they are placed in five classes: hagfish, lampreys, cartilaginous fish, ray-finned bony fish, and lobe-finned bony fish.

Name one other trait you would expect to find in the new species of fish. Explain your answers. • Summarize the evolution of fish. • Outline the ecology of the different fish classes. Are there actually ecosystems in the ocean? There are. Different types of fish live in different types of ecosystems. Shown above are tropical fish in a coral reef ecosystem. Some fish are deep-ocean bottom dwellers, whereas others live in shallow waters. Other fish may not be able to survive in the ocean, as they need freshwater. 
Evolution of  Fish 	  The evolution of fish from hagfish to finned fish is a long and involved process. One step in this evolution involves the change in function of gills. Invertebrate chordates use their gills to filter food out of water, not to absorb oxygen. In the early evolution of fish, there was a switch to using gills to absorb oxygen instead of to filter food. Gills consist of many thin, folded tissues that provide a large surface area for oxygen uptake. With more oxygen absorbed by the gills, fish could become much larger and more active. 
Timing of  Fish  Evolution 	  Ancestors of hagfish are thought to have been the earliest vertebrates. Their fossils date back to about 550 million years ago. Fossils of cartilaginous fish with jaws, resembling living sharks, first appeared in the fossil record about Fossilized fish shown in different sizes. 
The  Bony  Fish 	  At first, the lobe-finned bony fish were much more common than the ray-finned bony fish that dominate today. Lobe-finned fish were also ancestral to amphibians. Their stump-like appendages and lung-like organs evolved into amphibian legs and lungs. Ray-finned bony fish may have been the first fish to evolve in freshwater. They eventually became the most diverse and dominant class of fish. 
Ecology of  Fish 	  The habitats and diets of fish are varied. They live throughout the ocean and also in freshwater lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. However, there is one fish, the Mudskipper, that spends time on land. See URL atch?v=zGqae7vuUWo for additional information. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Fish  Food 	  Most fish are predators, but the nature of their prey and how they consume it differs from one class to another and even within classes. • Hagfish are deep-ocean bottom dwellers. They feed on other fish, either living or dead. They enter the body of their prey through the mouth or anus. Then they literally eat their prey from the inside out. • Lampreys generally live in shallow ocean water or freshwater. They either consume small invertebrates or suck blood from larger fish with their sucker mouth. • Cartilaginous fish such as sharks may live on the bottom of the ocean. However, most live in the water column. They prey on other fish and aquatic mammals or else consume plankton. • Bony fish may live in salt water or freshwater. They consume a wide range of foods. For example, they may eat algae, smaller fish, detritus, or dead organisms, depending on the species of fish. 
Fish at  Risk 	  Today, more than 1,000 species of fish are at risk of extinction. This is mainly because of human actions. Specific causes include over-fishing and habitat destruction caused by water pollution, dam building, and the introduction of non-native species. 
Summary 	  • The evolution of fish included a shift from using the gills for filtering food to using them to absorb oxygen from water. • The earliest fish, resembling living hagfish, evolved about 550 million years ago. • Adaptations that eventually evolved in fish include a complete vertebral column, jaws, and an endoskeleton made of bones instead of cartilage. • Fish live throughout the ocean and in freshwater lakes and streams. • Most fish are predators, but the nature of their prey and how they consume it may vary. • Many species of fish are threatened by human actions, such as water pollution and overfishing.

So how did vertebrates move from the water onto land? There had to be some major modifications. Modifications in how the animal moves, how the animal breathes, and modifications in the animals skin. 
Structure and  Function in  Amphibians 	  Amphibians are vertebrates that exist in two worlds: they divide their time between freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They share a number of features with air-breathing lungfish, but they also differ from lungfish in many ways. One way they differ is their appendages. Modern amphibians include frogs, salamanders, and caecilians, as shown Figure 12.16. Amphibians are the first true tetrapods, or vertebrates with four limbs. Amphibians have less variation in size than fish, ranging in length from 1 centimeter (2.5 inches) to 1.5 meters (about 5 feet). They generally have moist skin without scales. Their skin contains keratin, a tough, fibrous protein found in the skin, scales, feathers, hair, and nails of tetrapod vertebrates, from amphibians to humans. Some forms of keratin are tougher than others. The form in amphibian skin is not very tough, and it allows gases and water to pass through their skin. Examples of Living Amphibians. In what ways do these three amphibians appear to be similar? In what ways do they appear to be different? 
Amphibian  Ectothermy 	  Amphibians are ectothermic, so their internal body temperature is generally about the same as the temperature of their environment. When it’s cold outside, their body temperature drops, and they become very sluggish. When the outside temperature rises, so does their body temperature, and they are much more active. What do you think might be some of the pros and cons of ectothermy in amphibians? 
Amphibian  Organ  Systems 	  All amphibians have digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems. All three systems share a body cavity called the cloaca. Wastes enter the cloaca from the digestive and excretory systems, and gametes enter the cloaca from the reproductive system. An opening in the cloaca allows the wastes and gametes to leave the body. Amphibians have a relatively complex circulatory system with a three-chambered heart. Their nervous system is also rather complex, allowing them to interact with each other and their environment. Amphibians have sense organs to smell and taste chemicals. Other sense organs include eyes and ears. Of all amphibians, frogs generally have the best vision and hearing. Frogs also have a larynx, or voice box, to make sounds. Most amphibians breathe with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults. Additional oxygen is absorbed through the skin in most species. The skin is kept moist by mucus, which is secreted by mucous glands. In some species, mucous glands also produce toxins, which help protect the amphibians from predators. The golden frog shown in Figure

What changes must occur for these tadpoles to move onto land? These are tadpoles of the Yellow-Bellied Toad. Of course these tadpoles are born in the water. You can see the beginning of the formation of the hind limbs. 
Amphibian  Reproduction and  Development 	  Amphibians reproduce sexually with either external or internal fertilization. They attract mates in a variety of ways. For example, the loud croaking of frogs is their mating call. Each frog species has its own distinctive call that other members of the species recognize as their own. Most salamanders use their sense of smell to find a mate. The males produce a chemical odor that attracts females of the species. 
Amphibian  Eggs 	  Unlike other tetrapod vertebrates (reptiles, birds, and mammals), amphibians do not produce amniotic eggs. Therefore, they must lay their eggs in water so they won’t dry out. Their eggs are usually covered in a jelly-like substance, like the frog eggs shown in Figure 12.18. The “jelly” helps keep the eggs moist and offers some protection from predators. Amphibians generally lay large number of eggs. Often, many adults lay eggs in the same place at the same time. This helps to ensure that eggs will be fertilized and at least some of the embryos will survive. Once eggs have been laid, most amphibians are done with their parenting. 
Frog  Eggs.  Frog eggs are surrounded by 	  “jelly.” What is its function? 
Amphibian  Larvae 	  The majority of amphibian species go through a larval stage that is very different from the adult form, as you can see from the frog in Figure 12.19. The early larval, or tadpole, stage resembles a fish. It lacks legs and has a long tail, which it uses to swim. The tadpole also has gills to absorb oxygen from water. As the larva undergoes metamorphosis, it grows legs, loses its tail, and develops lungs. These changes prepare it for life on land as an adult frog. Frog Development: 
Adult.  A frog larva (tadpole) goes through 	  many changes by adulthood. Notice the visible changes that occur at each stage.

As the first vertebrates to evolve from life in the sea to life on land, amphibians share a number of important evolutionary adaptations. 
Classification of  Amphibians 	  There are about 6,200 known species of living amphibians. They are placed in three different orders: 
Frogs and  Toads 	  One feature that distinguishes frogs and toads from other amphibians is lack of a tail in adulthood. Frogs and toads also have much longer back legs than other amphibians. Their back legs are modified for jumping. Frogs can jump up to 20 times their own body length. That’s the same as you jumping at least 100 feet, or more than the length of a basketball court. Think how fast you could move if you could travel that far on one jump! Frogs and toads are closely related, but they differ in several ways. Generally, frogs spend more time in water, and toads spend more time on land. As you can see from Figure 12.20, frogs also have smoother, moister skin than toads, as well as longer hind legs. Frog and Toad. Frogs (a) and toads (b) are placed in the same amphibian order. What traits do they share? 
Salamanders and  Newts 	  Unlike frogs and toads, salamanders and newts keep their tails as adults (see Figure 12.21). They also have a long body with short legs, and all their legs are about the same length. This is because they are adapted for walking and swimming rather than jumping. An unusual characteristic of salamanders is their ability to regenerate, or regrow, legs that have been lost to predators. 
Salamander and  Newt.  Salamanders and 	  newts can walk or swim. Salamander on a leaf (left), newt swimming in the water (right). 
Caecilians 	  Caecilians are most closely related to salamanders. As you can see from Figure 12.22, they have a long, worm-like body without legs. Caecilians evolved from a tetrapod ancestor, but they lost their legs during the course of their evolution. 
Swimming  Caecilian.  Caecilians are the 	  only amphibians without legs. 
Summary 	  • There are about 6,200 known species of living amphibians. They are classified into three orders: frogs and toads, salamanders and newts, and caecilians. • Frogs and toads are adapted for jumping. Salamanders and newts may walk or swim.

Why were amphibians so successful? They might not have had many predators on land 365 million years ago. Given plenty of land and food, they had the resources to thrive. This is a frog fossil from the Eocene epoch. The vertebral column and four limbs are easily identifiable. 
Evolution of  Amphibians 	  Fossil evidence shows that amphibians evolved about 365 million years ago from a lobe-finned lungfish ancestor. As the earliest land vertebrates, they were highly successful. Some of them were much larger than today’s amphibians. For more than 100 million years, amphibians remained the dominant land vertebrates. Then some of them evolved into reptiles. Once reptiles appeared, with their amniotic eggs, they replaced amphibians as the dominant land vertebrates. 
Ecology of  Amphibians 	  Amphibians can be found in freshwater and moist terrestrial habitats throughout the world. The only continent without amphibians is Antarctica. Amphibians are especially numerous in temperate lakes and ponds and in tropical rainforests. 
Amphibians as  Prey and  Predators 	  Amphibians are an important food source for animals such as birds, snakes, raccoons, and fish. Amphibians are also important predators. As larvae, they feed mainly on small aquatic animals such as water insects. They may also feed on algae. As adults, amphibians are completely carnivorous. They may catch and eat worms, snails, and insects, as the frog in Figure 12.23 is doing. Unlike other amphibians, caecilians are burrowers. They use their head to dig in the soil, and they feed on earthworms and other annelids. Caecilians can be found in moist soil near rivers and streams in tropical regions. 
Frog  Predator.  A frog eating its insect 	  prey. 
The  Threat of  Amphibian  Extinction 	  Currently, almost one third of all amphibian species face the threat of extinction. The reasons include habitat loss, pollution, climate change, and the introduction of non-native species. Most of these problems are the result of human actions. Amphibians have permeable skin that easily absorbs substances from the environment. This may explain why they seem to be especially sensitive to pollution. Monitoring the health and survival of amphibians may help people detect pollution early, before other organisms are affected. 
Summary 	  • Amphibians evolved about 365 million years ago from a lobe-finned fish ancestor. • As the earliest land vertebrates, amphibians were highly successful for more than 100 million years until reptiles took over as the dominant land vertebrates. • Amphibians are found throughout the world except in Antarctica and Greenland. • Amphibians are important prey for animals such as birds, snakes, and raccoons. They are important predators of insects, worms, and other invertebrates. • Up to one third of all amphibian species are at risk of extinction because of human actions, such as habitat destruction, climate change, and pollution.

Why did amphibians evolve into reptiles? It probably has to do with food and land. Having to live close to water limits the resources available to a species. Having the ability to live away from water allowed reptiles to search for additional food. 
Structure and  Function in  Reptiles 	  Reptiles are a class of tetrapod vertebrates that produce amniotic eggs. They include crocodiles, alligators, lizards, snakes, and turtles. The reptile class is one of the largest classes of vertebrates. It consists of all amniotes except birds and mammals. Reptiles have several adaptations for living on dry land that amphibians lack. For example, as shown in Figure 12.24, the skin of most reptiles is covered with scales. The scales, which are made of very tough keratin, protect reptiles from injury and prevent them from losing water. 
Reptile  Respiration 	  The scales of reptiles prevent them from absorbing oxygen through their skin, as amphibians can. Instead, reptiles breathe air only through their lungs. However, their lungs are more efficient than the lungs of amphibians, with more surface area for gas exchange. This is another important reptile adaptation for life on land. 
Crocodile  Scales.  These crocodiles are 	  covered with tough, waterproof scales. Reptiles have various ways of moving air into and out of their lungs. Lizards and snakes use muscles of the chest wall for this purpose. These are the same muscles used for running, so lizards have to hold their breath when they run. Crocodiles and alligators have a large sheet of muscle below the lungs, called a diaphragm, that controls their breathing. This is a structure that is also found in mammals. 
Ectothermy in  Reptiles 	  Like amphibians, reptiles are ectotherms with a slow metabolic rate. Their metabolism doesn’t generate enough energy to keep their body temperature stable. Instead, reptiles regulate their body temperature through their behavior. For example, the crocodile in Figure 12.25 is soaking up heat from the environment by basking in the sun. Because of their ectothermy, reptiles can get by with as little as one tenth the food needed by endotherms such as mammals. Some species of reptiles can go several weeks between meals. Heat Transfer to an Ectothermic Reptile. 
This crocodile is being warmed by the 	  environment in three ways. Heat is radiating directly from the sun to the animal’s back. Heat is also being conducted to the animal from the rocks it rests on. 
In 	  addition, convection currents are carrying warm air from surrounding rocks to the animal’s body. 
Other  Reptile  Structures 	  Like amphibians, most reptiles have a heart with three chambers, although crocodiles and alligators have a fourchambered heart like birds and mammals. The reptile brain is also similar in size to the amphibian brain, taking into account overall body size. However, the parts of the reptile brain that control the senses and learned behavior are larger than in amphibians. Most reptiles have good eyesight and a keen sense of smell. Snakes smell scents in the air using their forked tongue (see Figure 12.26). This helps them locate prey. Some snakes have heat-sensing organs on their head that help them find endothermic prey, such as small mammals and birds. Staring into the Beautiful Cold-Blooded Eyes of Reptiles at URL is a pictorial display of numerous reptile eyes. 
Snake “ Smelling” the  Air.  A snake flicks 	  its tongue in and out to capture scent molecules in the air. See Reptiles at URL for an introduction to these animals.

What are the advantages of a water-tight egg? Obviously, water-tight eggs can be laid anywhere. They do not have to be kept constantly moist. There is no danger of the developing fetus dehydrating. Shown above is a turtle hatching. 
Reptile  Reproduction 	  Most reptiles reproduce sexually and have internal fertilization. Males have one or two penises that pass sperm from their cloaca to the cloaca of a female. Fertilization occurs within the cloaca, and fertilized eggs leave the female’s body through the opening in the cloaca. In a minority of species, the eggs are retained inside the female’s body until they hatch. Then the offspring leave the mother’s body through the cloaca opening. 
Amniotic  Eggs 	  Unlike amphibians, reptiles produce amniotic eggs (see Figure 12.27). The shell, membranes, and other structures of an amniotic egg protect and nourish the embryo. They keep the embryo moist and safe while it grows and develops. They also provide it with a rich, fatty food source (the yolk). The amniotic egg is an important adaptation in fully terrestrial vertebrates. 
It first 	  evolved in reptiles. The shells of reptile eggs are either hard or leathery. 
Reptile  Young 	  Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have a larval stage. Instead, newly hatched reptiles look like smaller versions of the adults. They are able to move about on their own, but they are vulnerable to predators. Even so, most reptile parents provide no care to their hatchlings. In fact, most reptiles don’t even take care of their eggs. For example, female sea turtles lay their eggs on a sandy beach and then return to the ocean. The only exceptions are female crocodiles and alligators. They may defend their nest from predators and help the hatchlings reach the water. If the young remain in the area, the mother may continue to protect them for up to a year. 
Summary 	  • Most reptiles reproduce sexually and have internal fertilization. • Reptile eggs are amniotic, so they can be laid on land instead of in water. • Reptiles do not have a larval stage, and their hatchlings are relatively mature. • Reptile parents provide little if any care to their young.

They are distinguished partly by their parrotlike feet, their separately mobile and stereoscopic eyes, their very long, highly modified, and rapidly extrudable tongues, crests or horns on their distinctively shaped heads, and the ability of some to change color. But there are approximately 160 species of chameleons. So how are they classified? 
Classification of  Reptiles 	  There are more than 8,200 living species of reptiles, with the majority being snakes or lizards. They are commonly placed in four different orders. The four orders are described in Table 12.2.

They are the least specialized of all 	  living reptiles; their brain is very similar to the amphibian brain; they have a three-chambered heart, but it is more primitive than the heart of other reptiles. 
Lizards: most have four legs for 	  running or climbing, and they can also swim; many change color when threatened; they have a threechambered heart. Snakes: they do not have legs, although they evolved from a tetrapod ancestor; they have a very flexible jaw for swallowing large prey whole; some inject poison into their prey through fangs; they have a three-chambered heart.

Summary 	  • There are more than 8,200 living species of reptiles, and they are placed in four orders: Crocodilia, which includes crocodiles and alligators; Sphenodontia, or tuataras; Squamata, which includes lizards and snakes; and Testudines, such as turtles and tortoises.

So what exactly is a dinosaur? Dinosaurs were not lizards. Rather, they were a separate group of reptiles with a distinct upright posture not found in lizards. Dinosaurs can be described as large, powerful reptiles. And many were very big. But dinosaurs were more than that. They were a varied group of animals with over 1,000 non-avian species. 
Evolution of  Reptiles 	  The earliest amniotes evolved about 350 million years ago. They resembled small lizards, but they were not yet reptiles. Their amniotic eggs allowed them to move away from bodies of water and become larger. They soon became the most important land vertebrates. 
Synapsids and  Sauropsids 	  By about 320 million years ago, early amniotes had diverged into two groups, called synapsids and sauropsids. Synapsids were amniotes that eventually gave rise to mammals. Sauropsids were amniotes that evolved into reptiles, dinosaurs, and birds. The two groups of amniotes differed in their skulls. The earliest known reptile, pictured in Figure 12.28, dates back about 315 million years. At first, synapsids were more successful than sauropsids. They became the most common vertebrates on land. However, during the Permian mass extinction 245 million years ago, most synapsids went extinct. Their niches were taken over by sauropsids, which had been relatively unimportant until then. This is called the Triassic takeover. 
Earliest  Reptile:  Hylonomus.  The earliest 	  known reptile is given the genus name Hylonomus. It was about 20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches) long, lived in swamps, and ate insects and other small invertebrates. 
Rise and  Fall of the  Dinosaurs 	  By the middle of the Triassic about 225 million years ago, sauropsids had evolved into dinosaurs. Dinosaurs became increasingly important throughout the rest of the Mesozoic Era, as they radiated to fill most terrestrial niches. This is why the Mesozoic Era is called the Age of the Dinosaurs. During the next mass extinction, which occurred at the end of the Mesozoic Era, all of the dinosaurs went extinct. Many other reptiles survived, however, and they eventually gave rise to modern reptiles. 
Evolution of  Modern  Reptile  Orders 	  to diverge were ancestors of turtles. The first turtle-like reptiles are thought to have evolved about 250 million years ago. Ancestral crocodilians evolved at least 220 million years ago. Tuataras may have diverged from squamates (snakes and lizards) not long after that. Finally, lizards and snakes went their separate ways about 150 million years ago. Traditional Reptile Phylogenetic Tree. This phylogenetic tree is based on physical traits of living and fossil reptiles. Trees based on DNA comparisons may differ from the traditional tree and from each other, depending on the DNA sequences used. Reptile evolution is currently an area of intense research and constant revision. 
Summary 	  • The earliest amniotes appeared about 350 million years ago, and the earliest reptiles evolved from a sauropsida ancestor by about 315 million years ago. • Dinosaurs evolved around 225 million years ago and dominated animal life on land until 65 million years ago, when they all went extinct. • Other reptiles survived and evolved into the classes of reptiles that exist today.

Where do reptiles live? Anywhere and everywhere. Shown here is a sea turtle. Obviously, this reptile lives in the ocean. But reptiles can also live in the desert, jungle, forest, or even your backyard. Reptiles live in practically every type of habitat. 
Ecology of  Reptiles 	  Today, reptiles live in a wide range of habitats. They can be found on every continent except Antarctica. Many turtles live in the ocean, while others live in freshwater or on land. Lizards are all terrestrial, but their habitats may range from deserts to rainforests, and from underground burrows to the tops of trees. Most snakes are terrestrial and live in a wide range of habitats, but some snakes are aquatic. Crocodilians live in and around swamps or bodies of freshwater or salt water. 
Reptile  Diets 	  What reptiles eat is also very diverse, but the majority of reptiles are carnivores. Large reptiles such as crocodilians are the top predators in their ecosystems, preying on birds, fish, deer, turtles, and sometimes domestic livestock. Their powerful jaws can crush bones and even turtle shells. Smaller reptiles—including tuataras, snakes, and many lizards—are also important predators, preying on insects, frogs, birds, and small mammals such as mice. Most terrestrial turtles are herbivores. They graze on grasses, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Marine turtles and some species of lizards are omnivores, feeding on plants as well as insects, worms, amphibians, and small fish. 
Reptiles at  Risk 	  Many species of reptiles, especially marine reptiles, are at risk of extinction. Some are threatened by habitat loss. For example, many beaches where turtles lay their eggs have been taken over and developed by people. Other marine reptiles have been over-hunted by humans. Marine turtles and their eggs are still eaten in some countries despite being protected species. Some reptiles are preyed upon by non-native species introduced by humans. For example, marine iguanas on the Galápagos Islands are threatened by dogs and cats that people have brought to the islands. The iguanas are slow and tame and have no adaptations to these new predators.

Why is flight so important to birds? One of the defining traits of many birds is the ability to fly. Obviously, flight is a major evolutionary advantage. But together with the ability to fly must come a number of structural modifications. What do you think these might be? 
Structure and  Function in  Birds 	  Birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates. They are bipedal, which means they walk on two legs. Birds also lay amniotic eggs with hard, calcium carbonate shells. Although birds are the most recent class of vertebrates to evolve, they are now the most numerous vertebrates on Earth. Why have birds been so successful? What traits allowed them to increase and diversify so rapidly? Birds can vary considerably in size, as you can see from the world’s smallest and largest birds, pictured in Figure 12.30. The tiny bee hummingbird is just 5 centimeters (2 inches) long, whereas the ostrich towers over people at a height of 2.7 meters (9 feet). All modern birds have wings, feathers, and beaks. They have a number of other unique traits as well, most of which are adaptations for flight. Flight is used by birds as a means of locomotion in order to find food and mates and to avoid predators. Although not all modern birds can fly, they all evolved from ancestors that could. 
Wings and  Feathers 	  Wings are an obvious adaptation for flight. They are actually modified front legs. Birds move their wings using muscles in the chest. These muscles are quite large, making up as much as 35 percent of a bird’s body weight. Range of Body Size in Birds. The bee hummingbird is the smallest bird. The ostrich is the largest. Feathers help birds fly and also provide insulation and serve other purposes. Birds actually have two basic types of feathers: flight feathers and down feathers. Both are shown in Figure 12.31. Flight feathers are long, stiff and waterproof. They provide lift and air resistance without adding weight. Down feathers are short and fluffy. They trap air next to a bird’s skin for insulation. 
Types of  Bird  Feathers.  These two types 	  of bird feathers have different uses. How is each feather’s structure related to its function? 
Organ  Systems  Adapted for  Flight 	  Birds need a light-weight body in order to stay aloft. Even so, flying is hard work, and flight muscles need a constant supply of oxygenand nutrient-rich blood. The organ systems of birds are adapted to meet these needs. • Birds have light-weight bones that are filled with air. They also lack a jaw, which in many vertebrates is a dense, heavy bone with many teeth. Instead, birds have a light-weight keratin beak without teeth. • Birds have air sacs that store inhaled air and push it into the lungs like bellows. This keeps the lungs constantly filled with oxygenated air. The lungs also contain millions of tiny passages that create a very large surface area for gas exchange with the blood (see Figure 12.32). • Birds have a relatively large, four-chambered heart. The heart beats rapidly to keep oxygenated blood flowing to muscles and other tissues. Hummingbirds have the fastest heart rate at up to 1,200 beats per minute. That’s almost 20 times faster than the human resting heart rate! • Birds have a sac-like structure called a crop to store and moisten food that is waiting to be digested. They also have an organ called a gizzard that contains swallowed stones. The stones make up for the lack of teeth by grinding food, which can then be digested more quickly. Both structures make it easier for the digestive system to produce a steady supply of nutrients from food.

Nervous  System and  Sense  Organs 	  Birds have a large brain relative to the size of their body. Not surprisingly, the part of the brain that controls flight is the most developed part. The large brain size of birds is also reflected by their high level of intelligence and complex behavior. In fact, birds such as crows and ravens may be more intelligent than many mammals. They are smart enough to use objects such as twigs for tools. They also demonstrate planning and cooperation. Most birds have a poor sense of smell, but they make up for it with their excellent sense of sight. Predatory birds have especially good eyesight. Hawks, for example, have vision that is eight times sharper than human vision. 
Summary 	  • Birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates. They are bipedal and have wings and feathers. • Bird organ systems are adapted for flight. For example, they have light-weight air-filled bones and a large four-chambered heart. • Birds also have relatively large brains and a high level of intelligence.

Is this pair of birds actually a “couple”? Yes. Birds do actually pair up each mating season, if not for life. And the male better be prepared to treat his female properly. There is actually an elaborate process in which the female chooses her mate. 
Bird  Reproduction 	  Reproduction in birds may be quite complicated and lengthy. Birds reproduce sexually and have separate sexes and internal fertilization, so males and females must mate for fertilization to occur. Mating is generally preceded by courtship. In most species, parents also take care of their eggs and hatchlings. 
Courtship and  Mating 	  Courtship is behavior that is intended to attract a mate. It may involve singing specific courtship songs or putting on some type of visual display. For example, a bird may spread out and display its tail feathers or do a ritualized mating “dance.” Typically, males perform the courtship behavior, and females choose a mate from among competing males. During mating, a male bird presses his cloaca against his mate’s cloaca and passes sperm from his cloaca to hers. After fertilization, eggs pass out of the female’s body, exiting through the opening in the cloaca. 
Nesting and  Incubation 	  Eggs are usually laid in a nest. The nest may be little more than a small depression in the ground, or it may be very elaborate, like the weaver bird nest in Figure 12.33. Eggs that are laid on the ground may be camouflaged to look like their surroundings (also shown in Figure 12.33). Otherwise, eggs are usually white or pastel colors such as pale blue or pink. Variation in Bird Nests. A weaver bird uses grasses to weave an elaborate nest (left). The eggs of a groundnesting gull are camouflaged to blend in with the nesting materials (right). After birds lay their eggs, they generally keep the eggs warm with their body heat while the embryos inside continue to develop. This is called incubation, or brooding. In most species, parents stay together for at least the length of the breeding season. In some species, they stay together for life. By staying together, the males as well as females can incubate the eggs and later care for the hatchlings. Birds are the only nonhuman vertebrates with this level of male parental involvement. 
Hatchlings 	  Ground-nesting birds, such as ducks and chickens, have hatchlings that are able to run around and feed themselves almost as soon as they break through the eggshell. Being on the ground makes them vulnerable to predators, so they need to be relatively mature when they hatch in order to escape. In contrast, birds that nest off the ground—in trees, bushes, or buildings—have hatchlings that are naked and helpless. The parents must protect and feed the immature offspring for weeks or even months. However, this gives the offspring more time to learn from the parents before they leave the nest and go out on their own.

Parental  Care 	  In birds, 90% to 95% of species are monogamous, meaning the male and female remain together for breeding for a few years or until one mate dies. Birds of all types, from parrots to eagles and falcons, are monogamous. Usually, the parents take turns incubating the eggs. Birds usually incubate their eggs after the last one has been laid. In polygamous species, where there is more than one mate, one parent does all of the incubating. The wild turkey is an example of a polygamous bird. The length and type of parental care varies widely amongst different species of birds. At one extreme, in a group of birds called the magapodes (which are chicken-like birds), parental care ends at hatching. In this case, the newlyhatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental help and can take care of itself right away. These birds are called precocial. Other precocial birds include the domestic chicken and many species of ducks and geese. At the other extreme, many seabirds care for their young for extended periods of time. For example, the chicks of the Great Frigatebird receive intensive parental care for six months, or until they are ready to fly, and then take an additional 14 months of being fed by the parents ( Figure 12.35). These birds are the opposite of precocial birds and are called altricial. In most animals, male parental care is rare. But it is very common in birds. Often both parents share tasks such as defense of territory and nest site, incubation, and the feeding of chicks. Since birds often take great care of their young, some birds have evolved a behavior called brood parasitism. This happens when a bird leaves her eggs in another bird’s nest. The host bird often accepts and raises the parasite bird’s eggs. 
Great  Frigatebird adults are known to care 	  for their young for up to 20 months after hatching, the longest in a bird species. Here, a young bird is begging for food.

With almost 10,000 species of birds, there are bound to be significant differences. 
Classification of  Birds 	  There are about 10,000 living species of birds. Almost all of them can fly, but there are several exceptions. 
Flightless  Birds 	  Some birds have lost the ability to fly during the course of their evolution. Several flightless birds are shown in adapted for running. The penguins shown in the figure are also flightless birds, but they have a very different body shape. That’s because they are adapted for swimming rather than running. Flightless Birds. Flightless birds that are adapted for running include the ostrich, kiwi, rhea, cassowary, and moa. Penguins are flightless birds adapted for swimming. 
Flying  Birds 	  Birds that are able to fly are divided into 29 orders that differ in their physical traits and behaviors. Table 12.3 describes seven of the most common orders. As shown in the table, the majority of flying birds are perching birds, like the honeyeater described in the last row of the table. The order of perching birds has more species than all the other bird orders combined. In fact, this order of birds is the largest single order of land vertebrates.

Summary 	  • There are about 10,000 living species of birds, almost all of which can fly. • Flying birds are divided into 29 orders. The most common orders include landfowl, waterfowl, shorebirds, diurnal and nocturnal raptors, parrots, and perching birds.

Did birds really evolve from dinosaurs? One is an ostrich, the other is a mononykus dinosaur. The structural relationship is obvious. Mononykus moved about on two legs, was very nimble, and could run at high speeds, something that would have been useful in the open desert plains where they lived. It had a small skull, and its teeth were small and pointed, suggesting that it ate insects and small animals, such as lizards and mammals. 
Evolution of  Birds 	  Birds are thought to have evolved from a group of bipedal dinosaurs called theropods. The ancestor of birds was probably similar to the theropod called Deinonychus, which is represented by the sketch in Figure 12.37. Fossils of Deinonychus were first identified in the 1960s. This was an extremely important discovery. It finally convinced most scientists that birds had descended from dinosaurs, which had been debated for almost a century. 
What was 	  Deinonychus is the genus name of an extinct dinosaur that is considered to be one of the closest non-bird relatives of modern birds. It lived about 110 million years ago in what is now North America. Deinonychus was a predatory carnivore with many bird-like features. For example, it had feathers and wings. It also had strong legs with clawed Extinct Bird Relative: Deinonychus. 
Deinonychus shared many traits with 	  birds. What similarities with birds to you see? feet, similar to modern raptors. Its respiratory, circulatory, and digestive systems were similar to those of birds as well. The location of fossilized eggs near Deinonychus fossils suggests that it may have brooded its eggs. This would mean that it was endothermic. (Can you explain why?) On the other hand, Deinonychus retained a number of reptile-like traits, such as jaws with teeth, and hands with claws at the tips of its wings. 
Evolution of  Flight 	  Scientists have long speculated about the evolution of flight in birds. They wonder how and why birds evolved wings from a pair of front limbs. Several hypotheses have been suggested. Here are just two: are modified arms that helped the animal leap higher. glide from branch to branch. Scientists still don’t know how or why wings and flight evolved, but they continue to search for answers. In addition to fossils, they are studying living vertebrates such as bats that also evolved adaptations for flight. 
Summary 	  • Birds are thought to have evolved from theropod dinosaurs around 150 million years ago. • Bird ancestors may have been similar to the extinct theropod Deinonychus, whose fossils convinced most scientists that birds evolved from dinosaurs. • Scientists still don’t know how or why wings and flight evolved, but they continue to search for answers.

Ecology of  Birds 	  Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats on all seven continents, from the Arctic to Antarctica. Because they are endothermic, birds can live in a wider range of climates than reptiles or amphibians, although the greatest diversity of birds occurs in tropical regions. Birds are important members of every ecosystem in which they live, occupying a wide range of ecological positions. 
Bird  Diets 	  Some birds are generalists. A generalist is an organism that can eat many different types of food. Other birds are highly specialized in their food needs and can eat just one type of food. Raptors such as hawks and owls are carnivores. They hunt and eat mammals and other birds. Vultures are scavengers. They eat the remains of dead animals, such as roadkill. Aquatic birds generally eat fish or water plants. Perching birds may eat insects, fruit, honey, or nectar. Many fruit-eating birds play a key role in seed dispersal, and some nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators. Bird beaks are generally adapted for the food they eat. For example, the sharp, hooked beak of a raptor is well suited for killing and tearing apart prey. The long beak of the hummingbird in Figure 12.38 co-evolved with the tube-shaped flowers from which it sips nectar. Hummingbird Sipping Nectar. A hummingbird gets nectar from flowers and pollinates the flowers in return. What type of relationship exists between the bird and the flowering plant? 
Birds at  Risk 	  Hundreds of species of birds have gone extinct as a result of human actions. A well-known example is the passenger pigeon. It was once the most common bird in North America, but overhunting and habitat destruction led to its extinction in the 1800s. Habitat destruction and use of the pesticide DDT explain the recent extinction of the dusky seaside sparrow. This native Florida bird was declared extinct in 1990. Today, some 1,200 species of birds are threatened with extinction by human actions. Humans need to take steps to protect this precious and important natural resource. What can you do to help?

One of these is not a mammal. Which one? Mammals are a class of endothermic vertebrates. They have four limbs and produce amniotic eggs. Examples of mammals include bats, whales, mice, and humans. Clearly, mammals are a very diverse group. Nonetheless, they share many traits that set them apart from other vertebrates. 
Characteristics of  Mammals 	  Two characteristics are used to define the mammal class. They are mammary glands and body hair (or fur). a nutritious fluid. It contains disease-fighting molecules as well as all the nutrients a baby mammal needs. Producing milk for offspring is called lactation. and communicating. For example, cats use their whiskers to sense their surroundings. They also raise their fur to look larger and more threatening (see Figure 12.39). Most mammals share several other traits. The traits in the following list are typical of, but not necessarily unique to, mammals. • The skin of many mammals is covered with sweat glands. The glands produce sweat, the salty fluid that helps cool the body. • Mammalian lungs have millions of tiny air sacs called alveoli. They provide a very large surface area for gas exchange.

This makes it more efficient and powerful for delivering oxygenated blood to tissues. • The brain of a mammal is relatively large and has a covering called the neocortex. This structure plays an important role in many complex brain functions. • The mammalian middle ear has three tiny bones that carry sound vibrations from the outer to inner ear. The bones give mammals exceptionally good hearing. In other vertebrates, the three bones are part of the jaw and not involved in hearing. • Mammals have four different types of teeth. The teeth of other vertebrates, in contrast, are all alike. 
Summary 	  • Mammals are a class of endothermic vertebrates. • Mammals have four limbs and produce amniotic eggs. • The mammal class is defined by the presence of mammary glands and hair (or fur). • Other traits of mammals include sweat glands in their skin, alveoli in their lungs, a four-chambered heart, and a brain covering called the neocortex.

Does this mammal breathe like all other mammals? Essentially, yes it does. A whale is a mammal, so it has a pair of lungs, not gills like fish. As shown here, whales take oxygen out of the air, not out of water. 
Eating and  Digesting  Food 	  Maintaining a high metabolic rate takes a lot of energy. The energy must come from food. Therefore, mammals need a nutritious and plentiful diet. The diets of mammals are diverse. Except for leaf litter and wood, almost any kind of organic matter may be eaten by mammals. Some mammals are strictly herbivores or strictly carnivores. However, most mammals will eat other foods if necessary. Some mammals are omnivores. They routinely eat a variety of both plant and animal foods. Most mammals also feed on a variety of other species. The few exceptions include koalas, which feed only on eucalyptus plants, and giant pandas, which feed only on bamboo. Types of mammalian diets and examples of mammals that eat them are given in Table 12.4. How would you classify your own diet? 
Foods  Eaten 	  herbivorous diet: plants leaves, grasses, shoots, stems, roots, tubers, seeds, nuts, fruits, bark, conifer needles, flowers 
Type of  Diet 	  rabbit, mouse, sea cow, horse, goat, elephant, zebra, giraffe, deer, elk, hippopotamus, kangaroo, monkey carnivorous diet: animals other mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, mollusks, worms, insects aardvark, anteater, whale, hyena, dog, jackal, dolphin, wolf, weasel, seal, walrus, cat, otter, mole omnivorous diet: plants and animals any of the foods eaten in herbivorous and carnivorous diets bear, badger, mongoose, fox, raccoon, human, rat, chimpanzee, pig Different diets require different types of digestive systems. Mammals that eat a carnivorous diet generally have a relatively simple digestive system. Their food consists mainly of proteins and fats that are easily and quickly digested. Herbivorous mammals, on the other hand, tend to have a more complicated digestive system. Complex plant carbohydrates such as cellulose are more difficult to digest. Some herbivores have more than one stomach. The stomachs store and slowly digest plant foods. Mammalian teeth are also important for digestion. Mammals have four different types of teeth. The teeth of other vertebrates, in contrast, are all alike. The four types of teeth are specialized for different feeding functions, as shown in Figure 12.41. Together, the four types of teeth can cut, tear, and grind food. This makes food easier and quicker to digest. 
Lungs and  Heart of  Mammals 	  Keeping the rate of metabolism high takes a constant and plentiful supply of oxygen. That’s because cellular respiration, which produces energy, requires oxygen. The lungs and heart of mammals are adapted to meet their oxygen needs. The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli. These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure 12.42). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they 
Mammalian  Teeth ( Human).  With their 	  different types of teeth, mammals can eat a wide range of foods. greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court! 
Alveoli of  Mammalian  Lungs.  Clusters of 	  alveoli resemble tiny bunches of grapes. They are surrounded by many blood vessels for gas exchange. Mammals breathe with the help of a diaphragm. This is the large muscle that extends across the bottom of the chest below the lungs. When the diaphragm contracts, it increases the volume of the chest. This decreases pressure on the lungs and allows air to flow in. When the diaphragm relaxes, it decreases the volume of the chest. This increases pressure on the lungs and forces air out. The four-chambered mammalian heart can pump blood in two different directions. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. The left side of the heart pumps blood containing oxygen to the rest of the body. Because of the dual pumping action of the heart, all of the blood going to body cells is rich in oxygen. 
The  Mammalian  Brain 	  Of all vertebrates, mammals have the biggest and most complex brain for their body size (see Figure 12.43). The front part of the brain, called the cerebrum, is especially large in mammals. This part of the brain controls functions such as memory and learning. Vertebrate Brains. 
Vertebrate brains 	  come in a range of sizes. Even the brains of mammals show a lot of variation in size. 
The area of the neocortex is greatest in 	  humans. The brains of all mammals have a unique layer of nerve cells covering the cerebrum. This layer is called the neocortex (the pink region of the brains in Figure 12.43). The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal. 
Intelligence of  Mammals 	  Mammals are very intelligent. Of all vertebrates, they are the animals that are most capable of learning. Mammalian offspring are fed and taken care of by their parents for a relatively long time. This gives them plenty of time to learn from their parents. By learning, they can benefit from the experiences of their elders. The ability to learn is the main reason that the large mammalian brain evolved. It’s also the primary reason for the success of mammals. 
Summary 	  • Mammals may be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. They have four types of teeth, so they can eat a wide range of foods. • Traits of the heart and lungs keep the cells of mammals well supplied with oxygen and nutrients. • Mammals have a relatively large brain and a high level of intelligence.

Is this bear cold? Not really. Like all mammals, polar bears maintain a stable internal temperature. They do not need to stay warm by lying in the sun. This allows them to live in cold climates. 
Endothermy in  Mammals 	  Many structures and functions in mammals are related to endothermy. Mammals can generate and conserve heat when it’s cold outside. They can also lose heat when they become overheated. How do mammals control their body temperature in these ways? 
How  Mammals  Stay  Warm 	  Mammals generate heat mainly by keeping their metabolic rate high. The cells of mammals have many more mitochondria than the cells of other animals. The extra mitochondria generate enough energy to keep the rate of metabolism high. Mammals can also generate little bursts of heat by shivering. Shivering occurs when many muscles contract a little bit all at once. Each muscle that contracts produces a small amount of heat. Conserving heat is also important, especially in small mammals. A small body has a relatively large surface area compared to its overall size. Because heat is lost from the surface of the body, small mammals lose a greater proportion of their body heat than large mammals. Mammals conserve body heat with their hair or fur. It traps a layer of warm air next to the skin. Most mammals can make their hair stand up from the skin, so it becomes an even better insulator. Even humans automatically contract these muscles when they are cold, causing goosebumps (see found in other vertebrates. Mammals raise their hair with tiny muscles in the skin. Even humans automatically contract these muscles when they are cold. They cause “goosebumps,” as shown here. 
How  Mammals  Stay  Cool 	  One way mammals lose excess heat is by increasing blood flow to the skin. This warms the skin so heat can be given off to the environment. That’s why you may get flushed, or red in the face, when you exercise on a hot day. You are likely to sweat as well. Sweating also reduces body heat. Sweat wets the skin, and when it evaporates, it cools the body. Evaporation uses energy, and the energy comes from body heat. Animals with fur, such as dogs, use panting instead of sweating to lose body heat (see Figure 12.45). Evaporation of water from the tongue and other moist surfaces of the mouth and throat uses heat and helps cool the body. Panting Dog. This dog is overheated. panting. 
Summary 	  • Mammals have several ways of generating and conserving heat, such as a high metabolic rate and hair to trap heat. • Mammals also have several ways to stay cool, including sweating or panting.

What allows this cheetah to be so fast? Do you think it has something to do with the placement of the limbs? Well, it does. Look closely at the cheetah’s body. Can you describe why it is so fast? 
Social  Living in  Mammals 	  Many mammals live in social groups. Social living evolved because it is adaptive. Consider these two examples: are most vulnerable to predators. than hunting alone. Then they share the food with the rest of the pride. For their part, adult males defend the pride’s territory from other predators. 
Locomotion in  Mammals 	  Mammals are noted for the many ways they can move about. Generally, their limbs are very mobile. Often, they can be rotated. Many mammals are also known for their speed. The fastest land animal is a predatory mammal. Can you guess what it is? Racing at speeds of up to 112 kilometers (70 miles) per hour, the cheetah wins hands down. In addition, the limbs of mammals let them hold their body up above the ground. That’s because the limbs are attached beneath the body, rather than at the sides as in reptiles (see Figure 12.46). Limb Positions in Reptiles and Mammals. The sprawling limbs of a reptile keep it low to the ground. A mammal has a more upright stance. Mammals may have limbs that are specialized for a particular way of moving. They may be specialized for running, jumping, climbing, flying, or swimming. Mammals with these different modes of locomotion are pictured in Figure The deer in the Figure 12.47 is specialized for running. Why? It has long legs and hard hooves. Can you see why the other animals in the figure are specialized for their particular habitats? Notice how arboreal, or tree-living animals, have a variety of different specializations for moving in trees. For example, they may have: • A prehensile, or grasping, tail. This is used for climbing and hanging from branches. • Very long arms for swinging from branch to branch. This way of moving is called brachiation. • Sticky pads on their fingers. The pads help them cling to tree trunks and branches.

Is this kangaroo a placental mammal? You know that female kangaroos have a pouch for the final development of their babies. So, no, kangaroos are not placental mammals. What is a placental mammal? 
Therian  Mammals 	  Like other female vertebrates, all female mammals have ovaries. These are the organs that produce eggs (see other vertebrates. They are the uterus and vagina. • The uterus (plural, uteri) is a pouch-like, muscular organ. The embryo or fetus develops inside the uterus. Muscular contractions of the uterus push the offspring out during birth. • The vagina is a tubular passageway through which the embryo or fetus leaves the mother’s body during birth. The vagina is also where the male deposits sperm during mating. Therian mammals are divided into two groups: placental mammals and marsupial mammals. Each group has a somewhat different reproductive strategy. Female Reproductive System of a Therian Mammal (Human). Therian mammals are viviparous, giving birth to an embryo or infant rather than laying eggs. 
The female reproductive system of all 	  therian mammals is similar to that of humans. 
Placental  Mammals 	  Placental mammals are therian mammals in which a placenta develops during pregnancy. The placenta sustains the fetus while it grows inside the mother’s uterus. Placental mammals give birth to relatively large and mature infants. Most mammals are placental mammals. 
The  Placenta 	  The placenta is a spongy structure. It consists of membranes and blood vessels from both mother and embryo (see also passes carbon dioxide and other wastes from the fetus to the mother. The placenta lets blood from the fetus and mother exchange substances without actually mixing. Thus, it protects the fetus from being attacked by the mother’s immune system as a “foreign parasite.” 
Pros and  Cons of  Placental  Reproduction 	  The placenta permits a long period of fetal growth in the uterus. As a result, the fetus can become large and mature before birth. This increases its chances of surviving. On the other hand, supporting a growing fetus is very draining and risky for the mother. The mother has to eat more food to nourish the fetus. She also becomes heavier and less mobile as the fetus gets larger. As a result, she may be less able to escape from predators. Because the fetus is inside her, she can’t abandon it to save her own life if she is pursued or if food is scarce. Giving birth to a large infant is also risky. It may even result in the mother’s death. Placenta of a Placental Mammal (Human). The placenta allows the exchange of gases, nutrients, and other substances between the fetus and mother. 
Summary 	  • Therian mammals are viviparous. They give birth to an embryo or infant rather than laying eggs. • The female reproductive system of a therian mammal includes a uterus and a vagina. • There are two groups of therian mammals: placental mammals and marsupials. • Placental mammals give birth to a relatively large and mature fetus. This is possible because they have a placenta to nourish the fetus and protect it from the mother’s immune system. This allows for a long period of growth and development before birth. • Because the offspring of placental mammals is relatively large and mature at birth, it has a good chance of surviving. However, carrying and giving birth to a large fetus is risky for the mother. It also requires her to eat more food.

Is it really a bear? The koala. Or sometimes called the koala bear. The koala is a marsupial native to Australia. And it is very different then any bear. 
Marsupials 	  Marsupials have a different way of reproducing that reduces the mother’s risks. A marsupial is a therian mammal in which the embryo is born at an early, immature stage. The embryo completes its development outside the mother’s body in a pouch on her belly. Only a minority of therian mammals are marsupials. They live mainly in Australia. Examples of marsupials are pictured in Figure 12.50. 
The  Marsupial  Embryo 	  The marsupial embryo is nourished inside the uterus with food from a yolk sac instead of through a placenta. The yolk sac stores enough food for the short period of time the embryo remains in the uterus. After the embryo is born, it moves into the mother’s pouch, where it clings to a nipple. It remains inside the pouch for several months while it continues to grow and develop. Even after the offspring is big enough to leave the pouch, it may often return to the pouch for warmth and nourishment. Eventually, the offspring is mature enough to remain outside the pouch on its own. Marsupials. Marsupials include the kangaroo, koala, and opossum. 
Pros and  Cons of  Marsupial  Development 	  In marsupials, the short period of development within the mother’s uterus reduces the risk of her immune system attacking the embryo. In addition, the marsupial mother doesn’t have to eat extra food or carry a large fetus inside her. The risks of giving birth to a large fetus are also avoided. Another pro is that the mother can expel the embryo from her pouch if she is pursued by a predator or if food is scarce. On the other hand, a newborn marsupial is tiny and fragile. Therefore, it may be less likely to survive than a newborn placental mammal. 
The  North  American  Marsupial:  The  Opossum 	  Most people think of opossums as scary creatures. Is this because they look kind of funny, walk kind of funny, have beady eyes and sharp teeth, and can emit a very foul odor? Maybe. But what is so different about opossums is that they are the only marsupial in North America. These opossums, however, can be beneficial to humans. They use their sharp teeth to crush bone –which means that they are good getting rid of unwanted rodents in your neighborhood. They have excellent immune systems and they emit that terrible odor for protection. Learn more about opossums at URL s-opossums/ and URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Summary 	  • Marsupials give birth to a tiny, immature embryo. The embryo then continues to grow and develop in a pouch on the mother’s belly. • Marsupial development is less risky for the mother. However, the embryo is fragile, so it may be less likely to survive than the fetus of a placental mammal. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • URL → Non-Majors Biology → Search: Mammals • Give examples of monotremes. • Describe monotreme reproduction. • Define cloaca. Can a mammal lay an egg? This is a mammal. But it is unlike placental or marsupial mammals. If a mammal does not develop within a placenta or a pouch, what type of development is left? Eggs! 
Monotremes 	  Only five living species of mammals are not therian mammals. They are called monotremes. Monotremes are mammals that reproduce by laying eggs. The only living monotreme species are the platypus and echidnas (see Australia). 
Eggs and  Lactation in  Monotremes 	  Female monotremes lack a uterus and vagina. Instead, they have a cloaca with one opening, like the cloacas of reptiles and birds. The opening is used to excrete wastes as well as lay eggs. Monotreme eggs have a leathery shell, like the eggs of reptiles. The eggs are retained inside the mother’s body for at least a couple of weeks. During that time, the mother provides the eggs with nutrients. Platypus females lay their eggs in a burrow. Echidna females have a pouch in which they store their eggs. Female monotremes have mammary glands but lack nipples. Instead, they “sweat” milk from a patch on their belly. This egg-laying, venomous, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal is a platypus, a monotreme mammal that reproduces by laying eggs. the echidna is a Like the platypus, monotreme. The only living monotreme species and New Guinea. inhabit Australia 
Pros and  Cons of  Monotreme  Reproduction 	  The mother’s risks are less in monotremes than in therian mammals. The mother doesn’t need to eat more or put herself at risk by carrying and delivering a fetus or an embryo. On the other hand, externally laid eggs are more difficult to protect than an embryo in a pouch or a fetus in a uterus. Therefore, monotreme offspring may be less likely to survive than the offspring of therian mammals. 
Summary 	  • Monotremes reproduce by laying eggs. • Monotremes have a cloaca instead of a uterus and vagina. The eggs pass through the opening of the cloaca. • Monotreme reproduction is the least risky for the mother. However, eggs are harder to protect than is an embryo or a fetus in a pouch or uterus. Therefore, monotreme offspring may have a lower chance of surviving than the offspring of therian mammals.

Mammalian  Ancestors 	  Ancestors of mammals evolved close to 300 million years ago. They were amniotes called synapsids. Figure 12.53 shows how modern mammals evolved from synapsids. The stages of evolution from synapsids to mammals are described below. 
Phylogeny of  Mammalian  Evolution.  This 	  diagram represents the evolution of mammals. 
Pelycosaurs 	  Synapsids called pelycosaurs became the most common land vertebrates during the first half of the Permian Period. A pelycosaur genus called Dimetrodon is shown in Figure 12.54. Dimetrodon had sprawling legs and walked like a lizard. It also had a fairly small brain. However, it had started to develop some of the traits of mammals. For example, it had teeth of different types. Pelycosaur Synapsid: Dimetrodon was a pelycosaur. about 275 million years ago. Dimetrodon. 
Therapsids 	  Some pelycosaurs gave rise to a group of animals called therapsids. The earliest therapsids lived about 260 million years ago. At first, the therapsids looked a lot like Dimetrodon. But after a while, they could easily be mistaken for mammals. They evolved a number of mammalian traits, such as legs positioned under the body instead of along the sides. Therapsids became the most common and diverse land vertebrates during the second half of the Permian Period. The Permian Period ended about 250 million years ago with a mass extinction. Most therapsids went extinct. Their niches were taken over by sauropsids. These were the amniotes that evolved into dinosaurs, reptiles, and birds. Not all therapsids went extinct, however. The few that remained no longer had to compete with many other therapsids. Some of them eventually evolved into mammals. 
Cynodonts 	  The surviving therapsids were small animals. Some of the most successful were the cynodonts (see Figure 12.55). They flourished worldwide during the first half of the Triassic Period. Some of them ate insects and were nocturnal, or active at night. Being nocturnal may have helped save them from extinction. Why? A nocturnal niche was one of the few niches that dinosaurs did not take over in the Triassic Period. Cynodonts became more mammal-like as they continued to evolve. Some of their mammalian traits may have been adaptations to their nocturnal niche. For example: • The ability to regulate body temperature might have been selected for because it would allow nocturnal animals to remain active in the cool of the night. • A good sense of hearing might have been selected for because it would be more useful than good vision when hunting in the dark. Probable Mammalian Ancestor: Cynodont. 
Cynodonts were mammal-like 	  therapsids. They may have been ancestral to mammals. They were about the size of a rat. By the end of the Triassic Period, cynodonts had become even smaller in size. They also had evolved many mammalian traits. For example, they had • Four different types of teeth. • A relatively large brain. • Three tiny bones in the middle ear. • A diaphragm for breathing. • Endothermy. • Lactation. • Hair. Cynodonts probably gave rise to mammals about 200 million years ago. However, they are not considered to be mammals themselves. In fact, competition with early mammals may have led to their extinction. They went extinct sometime during the Jurassic or Cretaceous Period. 
Summary 	  • Amniotes called synapsids were the ancestors of mammals. • Synapsids named pelycosaurs had some of the traits of mammals by 275 million years ago. • Some synapsids evolved into therapsids, which became widespread during the Permian Period. • The few therapsids that survived the Triassic takeover were small, arboreal insect eaters. They were also nocturnal. Being active at night may explain why they survived and evolved still more mammalian traits. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Oldest Mammal Fossil at URL ssil.html . • Outline the evolution of monotreme, marsupial, and placental mammals. Could you argue that the duckbilled platypus has some characteristics of other species? Like a bird or a fish? You could. This might suggest that an ancestor of this species may have been one of the early mammals to evolve. 
Evolution of  Early  Mammals 	  The earliest mammals evolved from cynodonts. But the evolution of mammals didn’t end there. Mammals continued to evolve. Monotreme mammals probably split off from other mammals first. They were followed by marsupials. Placental mammals probably evolved last. 
Evolution of  Monotremes 	  The first monotremes may have evolved about 150 million years ago. Early monotreme fossils have been found in Australia. An example is a genus called Steropodon, shown in Figure 12.56. It may have been the ancestor of the platypus. Early monotremes retained some of the traits of their therapsid ancestors. For example, they laid eggs and had a cloaca. These traits are still found in modern monotremes. 
Evolution of  Marsupials 	  The first marsupials may have evolved about 130 million years ago. One of the earliest was the extinct genus Sinodelphys. A fossil of this mammal is shown in. It is a remarkable fossil find. It represents a nearly complete animal. Even tufts of hair and imprints of soft tissues were preserved. 
Probable 	  Steropodon. Steropodon probably had a bill. 
Like 	  the Ancestor: platypus, Sinodelphys was about 15 centimeters (6 inches) long. Its limb structure suggests that it was a climbing animal. It could escape from predators by climbing into trees. It probably lived on a diet of insects and worms. 
Evolution of  Placental  Mammals 	  The earliest placental mammals may have evolved about 110 million years ago. The ancestor of placental mammals may be the extinct genus Eomaia. Fossils of Eomaia have been found in what is now China. It was only about 10 centimeters (4 inches) long. It was a tree climber and probably ate insects and worms. Eomaia had several traits of placental mammals. Figure 12.57 shows how Eomaia may have looked. Probable Ancestor of Placental Mammals: Eomaia. Eomaia lived a little over The placental mammal descendants of Eomaia were generally more successful than marsupials and monotremes. On most continents, placental mammals became the dominant mammals, while marsupials and monotremes died out. Marsupials remained the most common and diverse mammals in Australia. The reason for their success there is not yet resolved. 
Summary 	  • Monotremes evolved about 150 million years ago. Like modern monotremes, they had a cloaca and laid eggs. • Marsupials evolved about 130 million years ago. They were very small and ate insects and worms. • Placental mammals evolved about 110 million years ago. They were also small and climbed trees. • Placental mammals became the dominant land mammals. Most marsupials and monotremes died out, except in Australia. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • How Did Mammals Evolve at URL . • Summarize the evolution of modern mammals. Why so many different types of large mammals? Elephants, zebras, gazelles, giraffes, rhinoceros, lions, and hippopotamuses, to name just some of the animals of Africa. Each species must have its own niche, otherwise they could not coexist. So, there must be a role for each species within their ecosystem. 
Evolution of  Modern  Mammals 	  The Cretaceous Period ended with another mass extinction. This occurred about 65 million years ago. All of the dinosaurs went extinct at that time. Did the extinction of the dinosaurs allow mammals to take over? 
Traditional  View 	  Scientists have long assumed that the extinction of the dinosaurs opened up many niches for mammals to exploit. Presumably, this led to an explosion of new species of mammals early in Cenozoic Era. Few mammalian fossils from the early Cenozoic have been found to support this theory. Even so, it was still widely accepted until recently. 
View from the  Mammalian  Supertree 	  In 2007, an international team of scientists compared the DNA of almost all known species of living mammals. They used the data to create a supertree of mammalian evolution. The supertree shows that placental mammals started to diversify as early as 95 million years ago. What explains the diversification of mammals long before the dinosaurs went extinct? What else was happening at that time? One change was a drop in Earth’s temperature. This may have favored endothermic mammals over ectothermic dinosaurs. Flowering plants were also spreading at that time. They may have provided new and plentiful foods for small mammals or their insect prey. The supertree also shows that another major diversification of mammals occurred about 50 million years ago. Again, worldwide climate change may have been one reason. This time Earth’s temperature rose. The warmer temperature led to a greater diversity of plants. This would have meant more food for mammals or their prey.

How would you classify this mammal? Obviously it is a camel, but is there more to it than that? There are 17 orders of placental mammals. But then these mammals need to be further classified into families, genera, and finally species. 
Classification of  Placental  Mammals 	  Traditional classifications of mammals are based on similarities in structure and function. Increasingly, mammals are being classified on the basis of molecular similarities. DNA analyses has recently shown that the traditional orders include mammals that may not be closely related. 
Traditional  Classification 	  The most widely accepted traditional classification of mammals divides living placental mammals into 17 orders. These orders are shown in Table 12.6. This classification of mammals was widely accepted for more than 50 years. Placental mammals are still commonly placed in these orders. However, this classification is not very useful for studies of mammalian evolution. That’s because it groups together some mammals that do not seem to be closely related by descent from a recent common ancestor.

Phylogenetic  Classification 	  The mammalian supertree classifies placental mammals phylogenetically. It uses the analysis of DNA sequences to group together mammals that are evolutionarily closely related, sharing a recent common ancestor. These groups are not necessarily the same as the traditional groups based on structure and function. The supertree classification places placental mammals in four superorders. The four superorders and some of the mammals in them are: • Afrotheria—aardvarks, elephants, manatees. • Xenarthra—anteaters, sloths, armadillos. • Laurasiatheria—bats, whales, hoofed mammals, carnivores. • Supraprimates—primates, rabbits, rodents. All four superorders appear to have become distinct from one another between 85 and 105 million years ago. The exact relationships among the superorders are still not clear. Revisions in this classification of mammals may occur as new data become available. 
Summary 	  • Mammals used to be classified on the basis of similarities in structure and function into 17 different orders. • Recently, DNA analyses have shown that the traditional orders include mammals that are not closely related. • Phylogenetic classification, based on DNA data, groups placental mammals in four superorders.

Summary 	  Vertebrates. From fish to mammals. Obviously a tremendous amount of differences among these groups of species. But also many similarities. Fish had to evolve first. Then they moved onto land as amphibians, but they still had to live close to the water. Then they moved farther away from the water as reptiles. Reptiles could live anywhere, and they did. Reptiles became very large and dominated life on the planet. Some reptiles evolved flight and turned into birds. Others stayed small and became mammals. When all the large reptiles were extinct, what remained? Smaller animals, including mammals, which then became the dominant form of life.

Introduction 	  The Human Biology chapter provides an overview of the physiology of humans, from the skin inward. In addition to the skin, the skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, excretory, immune, and reproductive systems are described. • Outline the levels of organization of the human body. • Distinguish between cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. • List the types of tissues in the human body. • Give examples of the roles of organ systems. How is the human body similar to a well-tuned machine? Many people have compared the human body to a machine. Think about some common machines, such as drills and washing machines. Each machine consists of many parts, and each part does a specific job, yet all the parts work together to perform an overall function. The human body is like a machine in all these ways. In fact, it may be the most fantastic machine on Earth. As a preview of the human machine, the Emmy award-winning video, Inside The Living Body, at this link is highly recommended: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Levels of  Organization 	  The human machine is organized at different levels, starting with the cell and ending with the entire organism (see The human organism has several levels of organization. 
Cells 	  The most basic parts of the human machine are cells—an amazing 100 trillion of them by the time the average person reaches adulthood! Cells are the basic units of structure and function in the human body, as they are in all living things. Each cell carries out basic life processes that allow the body to survive. Many human cells are specialized in form and function, as shown in Figure 13.2. Each type of cell in the figure plays a specific role. For example, nerve cells have long projections that help them carry electrical messages to other cells. Muscle cells have many mitochondria that provide the energy they need to move the body. You can watch a video about some of the specialized cells of the human body and how they function at this link: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Different types of cells in the human body 	  are specialized for specific jobs. Do you know the functions of any of the cell types shown here? 
Tissues 	  After the cell, the tissue is the next level of organization in the human body. A tissue is a group of connected cells that have a similar function. There are four basic types of human tissues: epithelial, muscle, nervous, and connective tissues. These four tissue types, which are shown in Figure 13.3, make up all the organs of the human body. • Connective tissue is made up of cells that form the body’s structure. Examples include bone and cartilage. 
The human body consists of these four 	  tissue types. • Epithelial tissue is made up of cells that line inner and outer body surfaces, such as the skin and the lining of the digestive tract. Epithelial tissue protects the body and its internal organs, secretes substances such as hormones, and absorbs substances such as nutrients. • Muscle tissue is made up of cells that have the unique ability to contract, or become shorter. Muscles attached to bones enable the body to move. • Nervous tissue is made up of neurons, or nerve cells, that carry electrical messages. Nervous tissue makes up the brain and the nerves that connect the brain to all parts of the body. 
Organs and  Organ  Systems 	  After tissues, organs are the next level of organization of the human body. An organ is a structure that consists of two or more types of tissues that work together to do the same job. Examples of human organs include the brain, heart, lungs, skin, and kidneys. Human organs are organized into organ systems, many of which are shown in Figure of the system does part of the larger job. You can watch overviews of the human organ systems and their functions at the links below. • URL • URL • URL Your body’s 12 organ systems are shown below ( Table 13.1). Your organ systems do not work alone in your body. They must all be able to work together. For example, one of the most important functions of organ systems is to provide cells with oxygen and nutrients and to remove toxic waste products such as carbon dioxide. A number of organ systems, including the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, all work together to do this. Many of the organ systems that make up the human body are represented here.

Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • The organisation of the body at URL ts/5657/5657/5657_01.htm . • Organs Game at URL . • Define homeostasis. • Describe the importance of maintaining homeostasis. • Discuss the roles of the endocrine and nervous systems in maintaining homeostasis. What happens if stability is disrupted? Remove one stone and the whole arch collapses. The same is true for the human body. All the systems work together to maintain stability or homeostasis. Disrupt one system, and the whole body may be affected. 
Homeostasis 	  All of the organs and organ systems of the human body work together like a well-oiled machine. This is because they are closely regulated by the nervous and endocrine systems. The nervous system controls virtually all body activities, and the endocrine system secretes hormones that regulate these activities. Functioning together, the organ systems supply body cells with all the substances they need and eliminate their wastes. They also keep temperature, pH, and other conditions at just the right levels to support life processes. 
Maintaining  Homeostasis 	  The process in which organ systems work to maintain a stable internal environment is called homeostasis. Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments. Here are just three of the many ways that human organ systems help the body maintain homeostasis: • Respiratory system: A high concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood triggers faster breathing. The lungs exhale more frequently, which removes carbon dioxide from the body more quickly. • Excretory system: A low level of water in the blood triggers retention of water by the kidneys. The kidneys produce more concentrated urine, so less water is lost from the body. • Endocrine system: A high concentration of sugar in the blood triggers secretion of insulin by an endocrine gland called the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells absorb sugar from the blood. So how does your body maintain homeostasis? The regulation of your internal environment is done primarily through negative feedback. Negative feedback is a response to a stimulus that keeps a variable close to a set value ( Figure For example, your body has an internal thermostat. During a winter day, in your house a thermostat senses the temperature in a room and responds by turning on or off the heater. Your body acts in much the same way. When body temperature rises, receptors in the skin and the brain sense the temperature change. The temperature change triggers a command from the brain. This command can cause several responses. If you are too hot, the skin makes sweat and blood vessels near the skin surface dilate. This response helps decrease body temperature. Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose. Feedback Regulation. 
If a raise in body 	  temperature (stimulus) is detected (receptor), a signal will cause the brain to maintain homeostasis (response). Once the body temperature returns to normal, negative feedback will cause the response to end. This sequence of stimulus-receptorsignal-response is used throughout the body to maintain homeostasis. 
Positive  Feedback 	  Some processes in the body are regulated by positive feedback. Positive feedback is when a response to an event increases the likelihood of the event to continue. An example of positive feedback is milk production in nursing mothers. As the baby drinks her mother’s milk, the hormone prolactin, a chemical signal, is released. The more the baby suckles, the more prolactin is released, which causes more milk to be produced. Other examples of positive feedback include contractions during childbirth. When constrictions in the uterus push a baby into the birth canal, additional contractions occur. 
Failure of  Homeostasis 	  Many homeostatic mechanisms such as these work continuously to maintain stable conditions in the human body. Sometimes, however, the mechanisms fail. When they do, cells may not get everything they need, or toxic wastes may accumulate in the body. If homeostasis is not restored, the imbalance may lead to disease or even death.

What’s the worst thing you can do to hurt your health? Besides pathogens, many other dangers in the environment may negatively affect human health. For example, air pollution can cause lung cancer. It can also make asthma and other diseases worse. Bioterrorism is another potential threat in the environment. It may poison large numbers of people or cause epidemics of deadly diseases. But the worst thing you can do to yourself is smoke cigarettes. 
Carcinogens and  Cancer 	  A carcinogen is anything that can cause cancer. Cancer is a disease in which cells divide out of control. Most carcinogens cause cancer by producing mutations in DNA. 
Types of  Carcinogens 	  There are several different types of carcinogens. They include pathogens, radiation, and chemicals. Some carcinogens occur naturally. Others are produced by human actions. • Viruses cause about 15 percent of all human cancers. For example, the virus called hepatitis B causes liver cancer. • UV radiation is the leading cause of skin cancer. The radioactive gas known as radon causes lung cancer. • Tobacco smoke contains dozens of carcinogens, including nicotine and formaldehyde. Exposure to tobacco smoke is the leading cause of lung cancer. • Some chemicals that were previously added to foods, such as certain dyes, are now known to cause cancer. Cooking foods at very high temperatures also causes carcinogens to form (see Figure 13.6). Barbecued foods are cooked at very high temperatures. This may cause carcinogens to form. 
How  Cancer  Occurs 	  Mutations that lead to cancer usually occur in genes that control the cell cycle. These include tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes. • Tumor-suppressor genes normally prevent cells with damaged DNA from dividing. Mutations in these genes prevent them from functioning normally. As a result, cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide. • Proto-oncogenes normally help control cell division. Mutations in these genes turn them into oncogenes. Oncogenes promote the division of cells with damaged DNA. Cells that divide uncontrollably may form a tumor, or abnormal mass of cells. Tumors may be benign or malignant. Benign tumors remain localized and generally do not harm health. Malignant tumors are cancerous. There are no limits to their growth, so they can invade and damage neighboring tissues. Cells from malignant tumors may also break away from the tumor and enter the bloodstream. They are carried to other parts of the body, where new tumors may form. The most common and the most deadly cancers for U.S. adults are listed in Table 13.2. 
Most  Common  Types of  Cancer 	  after Skin Cancer (% of all cancers) prostate cancer (33%), lung cancer (13%) breast cancer (32%), (12%) lung cancer 
Most  Common  Causes of  Cancer 	  Deaths (% of all cancer deaths) lung cancer (31%), prostate cancer (10%) lung cancer (27%), breast cancer (15%) More cancer deaths in adult males and females are due to lung cancer than any other type of cancer. Lung cancer is most often caused by exposure to tobacco smoke. What might explain why lung cancer causes the most cancer deaths when it isn’t the most common type of cancer? 
Cancer  Treatment and  Prevention 	  Most cancers can be treated, and some can be cured. The general goal of treatment is to remove the tumor without damaging other cells. A cancer patient is typically treated in more than one way. Possible treatments include surgery, drugs ( chemotherapy), and radiation. Early diagnosis and treatment of cancer lead to the best chance for survival. That’s why it’s important to know the following warning signs of cancer: • change in bowel or bladder habits • sore that does not heal • unusual bleeding or discharge • lump in the breast or elsewhere • chronic indigestion or difficulty swallowing • obvious changes in a wart or mole • persistent coughing or hoarseness Having one or more warning signs does not mean you have cancer, but you should see a doctor to be sure. Getting routine tests for particular cancers can also help detect cancers early, when chances of a cure are greatest. For example, getting the skin checked regularly by a dermatologist is important for early detection of skin cancer (see 
Regular checkups with a dermatologist 	  can detect skin cancers early. Why is early detection important? You can take steps to reduce your own risk of cancer. For example, you can avoid exposure to carcinogens such as tobacco smoke and UV light. You can also follow a healthy lifestyle. Being active, eating a low-fat diet, and maintaining a normal weight can help reduce your risk of cancer.

Is some air actually bad for you? This question shouldn’t even need an answer. Yes, some air can be harmful. 
Air  Pollution and  Illness 	  Almost 5 million people die each year because of air pollution. In fact, polluted air causes more deaths than traffic accidents. Air pollution harms the respiratory and circulatory systems. Both outdoor and indoor air can be polluted. 
Outdoor  Air  Pollution 	  The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an assessment of the pollutants in the outdoor air based on their human health effects. The health risks associated with different values of AQI are shown in Figure 13.8. When AQI is high, you should limit the time you spend outdoors. Avoiding exposure to air pollution can help limit its impact on your health. People with certain health problems, including asthma, are very sensitive to the effects of air pollution. They need to be especially careful to avoid it. AQI generally refers to the levels of ground-level ozone and particulates. Ozone is a gas that forms close to the ground when air pollutants are heated by sunlight. It is one of the main components of smog (see Figure 13.9). Smog also contains particulates. Particulates are tiny particles of solids or liquids suspended in the air. They are Air quality is especially important for sensitive people. They include people with asthma, other respiratory illnesses, and cardiovascular diseases. produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels. The particles settle in airways and the lungs, where they cause damage. Smog clouds the city of Los Angeles, 
California.  Visible air pollution in the form 	  of smog is a sign that the air is unhealthy. 
Indoor  Air  Pollution 	  Indoor air may be even more polluted than outdoor air. It may contain harmful substances such as mold, bacteria, It may also contain carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a gas produced by furnaces and other and radon. devices that burn fuel. If it is inhaled, it replaces oxygen in the blood and quickly leads to death. Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless, but it can be detected with a carbon monoxide detector like the one in Figure 13.10. 
Summary 	  • Both outdoor and indoor air may contain pollutants that can cause human illness and death. A carbon monoxide detector warns you if the level of the gas is too high. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health at URL . America. • Define bioterrorism. • Explain how bioterrorism threatens human health. "The world has definitely changed." This statement is common at times. What might it refer to? Bioterrorism is a threat against civilized people worldwide. To be prepared, all levels of government have developed and conducted terrorism drills. These include protecting responders from harmful biological substances. 
Bioterrorism 	  Bioterrorism is the intentional release or spread of agents of disease. The agents may be viruses, bacteria, or toxins produced by bacteria. The agents may spread through the air, food, or water; or they may come into direct contact with the skin. Two of the best known bioterrorism incidents in the U.S. occurred early in this century: total of 22 people were infected, and 5 of them died of anthrax. intercepted at a mail-handling facility off White House grounds. Fortunately, the ricin toxin did not cause any illnesses or deaths.

Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Bioterrorism Overview at URL . • Give an overview of the human skeleton. • List the functions of the skeletal system. • Define cartilage, ligament and bone. • Describe mineral homeostasis. The skeletal system consists of all the bones of the body. How important are your bones? Try to imagine what you would look like without them. You would be a soft, wobbly pile of skin, muscles, and internal organs, so you might look something like a very large slug. Not that you would be able to see yourself—folds of skin would droop down over your eyes and block your vision because of your lack of skull bones. You could push the skin out of the way, if you could only move your arms, but you need bones for that as well! 
The  Skeleton 	  The human skeleton is an internal framework that, in adults, consists of 206 bones, most of which are shown in In addition to bones, the skeleton also consists of cartilage and ligaments: • Cartilage is a type of dense connective tissue, made of tough protein fibers, that provides a smooth surface for the movement of bones at joints. • A ligament is a band of fibrous connective tissue that holds bones together and keeps them in place. The skeleton supports the body and gives it shape. It has several other functions as well, including: The human skeleton consists of bones, cartilage, and ligaments. Maintaining mineral homeostasis is a very important function of the skeleton, because just the right levels of calcium and other minerals are needed in the blood for normal functioning of the body. When mineral levels in the blood are too high, bones absorb some of the minerals and store them as mineral salts, which is why bones are so hard. When blood levels of minerals are too low, bones release some of the minerals back into the blood, thus restoring homeostasis. 
Summary 	  • The adult human skeleton includes 206 bones and other tissues. • The skeleton supports the body, protects internal organs, produces blood cells, and maintains mineral homeostasis. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Skeletal System Anatomy and Physiology at URL enu/menu.html . • Skeleton Game at URL . • Describe the cells and tissues that make up bones. • Define collagen and bone matrix. • Distinguish between osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. • Distinguish between compact bone, spongy bone, bone marrow, and periosteum. Are bones living? It’s common to think of bones as not living. But bones are very much living. In fact, you are constantly making new bone tissue. That means that you are also constantly getting rid of bone. Bone is full of blood and nerves and all sorts of cells and proteins, making it an extremely complex living tissue. 
Structure of  Bones 	  Many people think of bones as being dead, dry, and brittle. These adjectives correctly describe the bones of a preserved skeleton, but the bones in a living human being are very much alive. As shown in Figure 13.12, the basic structure of bones is bone matrix, which makes up the underlying rigid framework of bones, composed of both compact bone and spongy bone. The bone matrix consists of tough protein fibers, mainly collagen, that become hard and rigid due to mineralization with calcium crystals. Bone matrix is crisscrossed by blood vessels and nerves and also contains specialized bone cells that are actively involved in metabolic processes. You can watch an animated video of bone matrix and other structures of bone at this link: URL om/watch?v=4qTiw8lyYbs . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Bone matrix provides bones with their 	  basic structure. Notice the spongy bone in the middle, and the compact bone towards the outer region. The osteon is the functional unit of compact bone. 
Bone  Cells 	  There are three types of specialized cells in human bones: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. These cells are responsible for bone growth and mineral homeostasis. • Osteoblasts make new bone cells and secrete collagen that mineralizes to become bone matrix. They are responsible for bone growth and the uptake of minerals from the blood. • Osteocytes regulate mineral homeostasis. They direct the uptake of minerals from the blood and the release of minerals back into the blood as needed. • Osteoclasts dissolve minerals in bone matrix and release them back into the blood. Bones are far from static, or unchanging. Instead, they are dynamic, living tissues that are constantly being reshaped. Under the direction of osteocytes, osteoblasts continuously build up bone, while osteoclasts continuously break it down. You can watch an animated video of these processes in bone at URL RJ2mu0 . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Bone  Tissues 	  Bones consist of different types of tissue, including compact bone, spongy bone, bone marrow, and periosteum. All of these tissue types are shown in Figure 13.13. • Compact bone makes up the dense outer layer of bone. Its functional unit is the osteon. Compact bone is very hard and strong. • Spongy bone is found inside bones and is lighter and less dense than compact bone. This is because spongy bone is porous. • Bone marrow is a soft connective tissue that produces blood cells. It is found inside the pores of spongy bone. • Periosteum is a tough, fibrous membrane that covers and protects the outer surfaces of bone. 
This bone contains different types of bone 	  tissue. How does each type of tissue contribute to the functions of bone? 
Summary 	  • Under the direction of osteocytes, osteoblasts continuously build up bone, while osteoclasts continuously break down bone. These processes help maintain mineral homeostasis. • Bone tissues include compact bone, spongy bone, bone marrow, and periosteum. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Bone structure and Function at URL . • Define ossification. • Explain how bones grow and develop. How do bones grow? Bones are hard structures. So how do they grow? Well, bones are a living tissue. They have a blood supply. You are consistently making new bone. In fact, the human skeleton is replaced every 7-10 years. But how do bones grow? From their ends, where they have cartilage. 
Growth and  Development of  Bones 	  Early in the development of a human fetus, the skeleton is made entirely of cartilage. The relatively soft cartilage gradually turns into hard bone through ossification. This is a process in which mineral deposits replace cartilage. As shown in Figure 13.14, ossification of long bones, which are found in the arms and legs, begins at the center of the bones and continues toward the ends. By birth, several areas of cartilage remain in the skeleton, including growth plates at the ends of the long bones. This cartilage grows as the long bones grow, so the bones can keep increasing in length during childhood. In the late teens or early twenties, a person reaches skeletal maturity. By then, all of the cartilage has been replaced by bone, so no further growth in bone length is possible. However, bones can still increase in thickness. This may occur in response to increased muscle activity, such as weight training. 
Summary 	  • Bones become increasingly ossified and grow larger during fetal development, childhood, and adolescence. • When skeletal maturity is reached at about age 20, no additional growth in bone length can occur. 
Long bones ossify and get longer as they 	  grow and develop. These bones grow from their ends, known as the epiphysis, and the presence of a growth plate, or epiphyseal line, signifies that the bone is still growing.

What explains this? turns 18 and goes to college. Jana recently injured her leg, and her doctor took an X-ray of it. Based on the X-ray, the doctor determined that Jana had reached skeletal maturity. How much taller is Jana likely to grow? Explain your answer. • Give examples of different types of joints. • Distinguish between immovable, partly movable, and movable joints. • Compare a ball-and-socket joint to a hinge joint. What allows running? Running. A means of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. The knees, which connect one part of the leg to the other, have to allow the legs to move. The knee is a joint, the part of the skeletal system that connects bones. 
Joints 	  A joint is a place where two or more bones of the skeleton meet. With the help of muscles, joints work like mechanical levers, allowing the body to move with relatively little force. The surfaces of bones at joints are covered with a smooth layer of cartilage that reduces friction at the points of contact between the bones. 
Types of  Joints 	  There are three main types of joints: immovable, partly movable, and movable. For a video about these types of joints, go to the link below. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Immovable joints allow no movement because the bones at these joints are held securely together by dense collagen. The bones of the skull are connected by immovable joints. • Partly movable joints allow only very limited movement. Bones at these joints are held in place by cartilage. The ribs and sternum are connected by partly movable joints. • Movable joints allow the most movement. Bones at these joints are connected by ligaments. Movable joints are the most common type of joints in the body, so they are described in more detail next. 
Movable  Joints 	  Movable joints are also known as synovial joints. This is because the space between the bones is filled with a thick fluid, called synovial fluid, that cushions the joint (see Figure 13.15). 
A movable, or synovial, joint is protected 	  and cushioned by cartilage and synovial fluid. There are a variety of types of movable joints, which are illustrated in Figure 13.16. The joints are classified by how they move. For example, a ball-and-socket joint, such as the shoulder, has the greatest range of motion, allowing movement in several directions. Other movable joints, including hinge joints such as the knee, allow less movement. You can watch an animation of movable joints and how they function at this link: • URL .

Do you think this would hurt? Why? That would probably hurt. And hurt a lot. Broken bones, or fractures, may be one of the more common problems of the skeletal system. And this one would probably need surgery to fix. But, in addition to broken bones, there are other problems and diseases of the skeletal system. 
Skeletal  System  Problems 	  Despite their hardness and strength, bones can suffer from injury and disease. Bone problems include fractures, osteoarthritis, and rickets. • Fractures are breaks in bone, usually caused by excessive stress on bone. Fractures heal when osteoblasts form new bone. The animation at this link shows how this happens: URL VougiCEgH8 . Soon after a fracture, the body begins to repair the break. The area becomes swollen and sore. Within a few days, bone cells travel to the break site and begin to rebuild the bone. It takes about two to three months before compact and spongy bone form at the break site. Sometimes the body needs extra help in repairing a broken bone. In such a case, a surgeon will piece a broken bone together with metal pins. Moving the broken pieces together will help keep the bone from moving and give the body a chance to repair the break. • Osteoarthritis is a condition in which cartilage breaks down in joints due to wear and tear, causing joint stiffness and pain. For a brief animation about osteoarthritis, go to this link: URL teoarthritis-61312377 . Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones lose mass and become more fragile than they should be. Osteoporosis also makes bones more likely to break. Two of the easiest ways to prevent osteoporosis are eating a healthy diet that has the right amount of calcium and vitamin D and to do some sort of weight-bearing exercise every day. Foods that are a good source of calcium include milk, yogurt, and cheese. Non-dairy sources of calcium include Chinese cabbage, kale, and broccoli. Many fruit juices, fruit drinks, tofu, and cereals have calcium added to them. It is recommended that teenagers get 1300 mg of calcium every day. For example, one cup (8 fl. oz.) of milk provides about 300 mg of calcium, or about 30% of the daily requirement. • Rickets is softening of the bones in children that occurs because bones do not have enough calcium. Rickets can lead to fractures and bowing of the leg bones, which is illustrated in the Figure 13.17. 
The bones of a child with rickets are so 	  soft that the weight of the body causes them to bend.

Why would a person with osteoporosis have a greater-than-normal risk of bone fractures? • Identify the three types of human muscle tissue. • Compare skeletal muscle to cardiac muscle and to smooth muscle. What exactly are muscles? Does the word "muscle" make you think of the biceps of a weightlifter, like the man in pictured above? Muscles such as biceps that move the body are easy to feel and see, but they aren’t the only muscles in the human body. Many muscles are deep within the body. They form the walls of internal organs such as the heart and stomach. You can flex your biceps like a body builder, but you cannot control the muscles inside you. It’s a good thing that they work on their own without any conscious effort on your part, because movement of these muscles is essential for survival. What Are Muscles? The muscular system consists of all the muscles of the body. Muscles are organs composed mainly of muscle cells, which are also called muscle fibers. Each muscle fiber is a very long, thin cell that can do something no other cell can do. It can contract, or shorten. Muscle contractions are responsible for virtually all the movements of the body, both inside and out. There are three types of muscle tissues in the human body: cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle tissues. They are shown in Figure 13.18 and described below. You can also watch an overview of the three types at this link: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Types of Muscle Tissue. Both skeletal and cardiac muscles appear striated, or striped, because their cells are arranged in bundles. Smooth muscles are not striated because their cells are arranged in sheets instead of bundles. 
Smooth  Muscle 	  Muscle tissue in the walls of internal organs such as the stomach and intestines is smooth muscle. When smooth muscle contracts, it helps the organs carry out their functions. For example, when smooth muscle in the stomach contracts, it squeezes the food inside the stomach, which helps break the food into smaller pieces. Contractions of smooth muscle are involuntary. This means they are not under conscious control. 
Skeletal  Muscle 	  Muscle tissue that is attached to bone is skeletal muscle. Whether you are blinking your eyes or running a marathon, you are using skeletal muscle. Contractions of skeletal muscle are voluntary, or under conscious control. When skeletal muscle contracts, bones move. Skeletal muscle is the most common type of muscle in the human body. 
Cardiac  Muscle 	  Cardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart. When cardiac muscle contracts, the heart beats and pumps blood. Cardiac muscle contains a great many mitochondria, which produce ATP for energy. This helps the heart resist fatigue. Contractions of cardiac muscle are involuntary, like those of smooth muscle. Cardiac muscle, like skeletal muscle, is arranged in bundles, so it appears striated, or striped. 
Summary 	  • There are three types of human muscle tissue: smooth muscle (in internal organs), skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle (only in the heart). Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Muscular System: Facts, Functions Diseases at URL ts-functions-diseases.html . • Muscles Game at URL . • Describe the structure of skeletal muscle. • Explain how skeletal muscles move bones. How do your bones move? By the contraction and extension of your skeletal muscles. Notice how the muscles are attached to the bones. The muscles pull on the bones, causing movement. 
Skeletal  Muscles 	  There are well over 600 skeletal muscles in the human body, some of which are identified in Figure 13.19. Skeletal muscles vary considerably in size, from tiny muscles inside the middle ear to very large muscles in the upper leg. 
Structure of  Skeletal  Muscles 	  Each skeletal muscle consists of hundreds or even thousands of skeletal muscle fibers. The fibers are bundled together and wrapped in connective tissue, as shown Figure 13.20. The connective tissue supports and protects the delicate muscle cells and allows them to withstand the forces of contraction. It also provides pathways for nerves and blood vessels to reach the muscles. Skeletal muscles work hard to move body parts. They need a rich blood supply to provide them with nutrients and oxygen and to carry away their wastes.

A skeletal 	  muscle contains bundles of muscle fibers inside a “coat” of connective tissue. “The Anatomy of a Muscle Cell” is available at URL (16:32). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Skeletal  Muscles and  Bones 	  Skeletal muscles are attached to the skeleton by tough connective tissues called tendons (see Figure 13.20). Many skeletal muscles are attached to the ends of bones that meet at a joint. The muscles span the joint and connect the bones. When the muscles contract, they pull on the bones, causing them to move. You can watch a video showing how muscles and bones move together at this link: URL ?v=7Rzi7zYlWno . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Muscles can only contract. They cannot actively extend, or lengthen. Therefore, to move bones in opposite directions, pairs of muscles must work in opposition. For example, the biceps and triceps muscles of the upper arm work in opposition to bend and extend the arm at the elbow (see Figure 13.21). You can watch an animation of these two muscles working in opposition at the link below. What other body movements do you think require opposing muscle pairs? URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Use  It or  Lose  It 	  In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure 13.22). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. 
Summary 	  • Skeletal muscles are attached to the skeleton and cause bones to move when they contract. 
Triceps and biceps muscles in the upper 	  arm are opposing muscles. 
This exercise pits human muscles against 	  a force. What force is it? Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Skeletal Muscle at URL . • Explain how muscles contract according to the sliding filament theory. • Define sarcomere and Z-line. • Describe the interactions of actin and myosin. What makes a muscle contract? It starts with a signal from the nervous system. So it starts with a signal from your brain. The signal goes through your nervous system to your muscle. Your muscle contracts, and your bones move. And all this happens incredibly fast. 
Muscle  Contraction 	  Muscle contraction occurs when muscle fibers get shorter. Literally, the muscle fibers get smaller in size. To understand how this happens, you need to know more about the structure of muscle fibers. 
Structure of  Muscle  Fibers 	  Each muscle fiber contains hundreds of organelles called myofibrils. Each myofibril is made up of two types of protein filaments: actin filaments, which are thinner, and myosin filaments, which are thicker. Actin filaments are anchored to structures called Z lines (see Figure 13.23). The region between two Z lines is called a sarcomere. Within a sarcomere, myosin filaments overlap the actin filaments. The myosin filaments have tiny structures called cross bridges that can attach to actin filaments. 
Sarcomere.  A sarcomere contains actin 	  and myosin filaments between two Z lines. 
Sliding  Filament  Theory 	  The most widely accepted theory explaining how muscle fibers contract is called the sliding filament theory. According to this theory, myosin filaments use energy from ATP to “walk” along the actin filaments with their cross bridges. This pulls the actin filaments closer together. The movement of the actin filaments also pulls the Z lines closer together, thus shortening the sarcomere. You can watch this occurring in a video animation at the link below. URL 
Wg 	  Click image to the left or use the URL below. When all of the sarcomeres in a muscle fiber shorten, the fiber contracts. A muscle fiber either contracts fully or it doesn’t contract at all. The number of fibers that contract determines the strength of the muscular force. When more fibers contract at the same time, the force is greater. Actin, myosin and muscle contraction are discussed at URL (9:38). Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Muscles and  Nerves 	  Muscles cannot contract on their own. They need a stimulus from a nerve cell to “tell” them to contract. Let’s say you decide to raise your hand in class. Your brain sends electrical messages to nerve cells, called motor neurons, in your arm and shoulder. The motor neurons, in turn, stimulate muscle fibers in your arm and shoulder to contract, causing your arm to rise. Involuntary contractions of cardiac and smooth muscles are also controlled by nerves. 
Summary 	  • According to the sliding filament theory, a muscle fiber contracts when myosin filaments pull actin filaments closer together and thus shorten sarcomeres within a fiber. • When all the sarcomeres in a muscle fiber shorten, the fiber contracts.

Click image to the left or use the URL below. What is integumentary? Because the organs of the integumentary system are external to the body, you may think of them as little more than “accessories,” like clothing or jewelry. But the organs of the integumentary system serve important biological functions. They provide a protective covering for the body and help the body maintain homeostasis. For an overview of the integumentary system, you can watch the animation at this link: URL atch?v=IAAt_MfIJ-Y 
The  Skin 	  The skin is the major organ of the integumentary system, which also includes the nails and hair. In fact, the skin is the body’s largest organ, and a remarkable one at that. Consider these skin facts. The average square inch (6.5 cm2) of skin has 20 blood vessels, 650 sweat glands, and more than a thousand nerve endings. It also has an incredible about as thick as the cover of a book. You can watch an excellent video introduction to the skin and its marvels at the following link: URL be.com/watch?v=uH_uzjY2bEE&feature=fvw . Click image to the left or use the URL below. Although the skin is thin, it consists of two distinct layers, called the epidermis and the dermis. These layers are shown in Figure 13.24. You can watch animations of the two layers of skin and how they function at these links: • URL • URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Layers of  Human  Skin.  The outer layer 	  of the skin is the epidermis, and the inner layer is the dermis. Most skin structures originate in the dermis. 
Epidermis 	  The epidermis is the outer layer of skin, consisting of epithelial cells and little else (see Figure 13.25). For example, there are no nerve endings or blood vessels in the epidermis. The innermost cells of the epidermis are continuously dividing through mitosis to form new cells. The newly formed cells move up through the epidermis toward the skin surface, while producing a tough, fibrous protein called keratin. The cells become filled with keratin and die by the Cell Layers of the Epidermis. The epidermis consists mainly of epithelial cells. time they reach the surface, where they form a protective, waterproof layer called the stratum corneum. The dead cells are gradually shed from the surface of the skin and replaced by other cells. The epidermis also contains melanocytes, which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D. Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. 
Dermis 	  The dermis is the lower layer of the skin, located directly beneath the epidermis (see Figure 13.26). It is made of tough connective tissue and attached to the epidermis by collagen fibers. The dermis contains blood vessels and nerve endings. Because of the nerve endings, skin can feel touch, pressure, heat, cold, and pain. The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands. • Hair follicles are the structures where hairs originate. Hairs grow out of follicles, pass through the epidermis, and exit at the surface of the skin. • Sebaceous glands produce an oily substance called sebum. Sebum is secreted into hair follicles and makes its way to the skin surface. It waterproofs the hair and skin and helps prevent them from drying out. Sebum also has antibacterial properties, so it inhibits the growth of microorganisms on the skin. • Sweat glands produce the salty fluid called sweat, which contains excess water, salts, and other waste products. The glands have ducts that pass through the epidermis and open to the surface through pores in the skin. 
Functions of the  Skin 	  The skin has multiple roles in the body. Many of these roles are related to homeostasis. The skin’s main functions are preventing water loss from the body and serving as a barrier to the entry of microorganisms. In addition, melanin in the skin blocks UV light and protects deeper layers from its damaging effects. The skin also helps regulate body temperature. When the body is too warm, sweat is released by the sweat glands and spreads over the skin surface. As the sweat evaporates, it cools the body. Blood vessels in the skin also dilate,

This allows more blood to flow through the skin, bringing body heat to the surface, where it radiates into the environment. When the body is too cool, sweat glands stop producing sweat, and blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow, thus conserving body heat. 
Skin  Problems 	  In part because it is exposed to the environment, the skin is prone to injury and other problems. Two common problems of the skin are acne and skin cancer (see Figure 13.27). • Acne is a condition in which red bumps called pimples form on the skin due to a bacterial infection. It affects more than 85 percent of teens and may continue into adulthood. The underlying cause of acne is excessive secretion of sebum, which plugs hair follicles and makes them good breeding grounds for bacteria. At the following link, you can watch an animation showing how acne develops: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Skin cancer is a disease in which skin cells grow out of control. It is caused mainly by excessive exposure to UV light. People with lighter skin are at greater risk of developing skin cancer because they have less melanin to block harmful UV radiation. The best way to prevent skin cancer is to avoid UV exposure by using sunscreen and wearing protective clothing. 
Ds of  Skin  Cancer.  A brown spot 	  on the skin is likely to be a harmless mole, but it could be a sign of skin cancer. Unlike moles, skin cancers are generally asymmetrical, have irregular borders, may be very dark in color, and may have a relatively great diameter. • The skin consists of two layers: the epidermis, which contains mainly epithelial cells, and the dermis, which contains most of skin’s other structures, including blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles, and glands. • Skin protects the body from injury, water loss, and microorganisms. It also plays a major role in maintaining a stable body temperature. • Common skin problems include acne and skin cancer.

Would you believe this is a close-up of your hair and scalp? Well maybe not yours. But some other person’s. Hair is an integral part of the integumentary system. And although many people may lose some or all of the hair on top of their head, they still have hair on their arms and legs that perform important functions. 
Nails and  Hair 	  In addition to the skin, the integumentary system includes the nails and hair. Like the skin, these organs help the body maintain homeostasis. 
Nails 	  Fingernails and toenails consist of specialized epidermal cells that are filled with keratin. The keratin makes them tough and hard, which is important for the functions they serve. Fingernails prevent injury by forming protective plates over the ends of the fingers. They also enhance sensation by acting as a counterforce to the sensitive fingertips when objects are handled. Nails are similar to claws in other animals. They cover the tips of fingers and toes. Fingernails and toenails both grow from nail beds. As the nail grows, more cells are added at the nail bed. Older cells get pushed away from the nail bed and the nail grows longer. There are no nerve endings in the nail. Otherwise cutting your nails would hurt a lot! 
Hair 	  Hair is a fiber that is found only in mammals. Its main component is keratin. A hair shaft consists of dead, keratinfilled cells that overlap each other like the shingles on a roof (see Figure 13.28). Like roof shingles, the overlapping cells help shed water from the hair. 
Shaft of  Human  Hair.  This shaft of hair is 	  magnified to show its overlapping cells. Hair helps to insulate and protect the body. Head hair is especially important in preventing heat loss from the body. Eyelashes and eyebrows protect the eyes from water, dirt, and other irritants. Hairs in the nose trap dust particles and microorganisms in the air and prevent them from reaching the lungs. Hair also provides sensory input when objects brush against it or it sways in moving air.

The  Nervous  System 	  A small child darts in front of your bike as you race down the street. You see the child and immediately react. You put on the brakes, steer away from the child, and yell out a warning, all in just a split second. How do you respond so quickly? Such rapid responses are controlled by your nervous system. The nervous system is a complex network of nervous tissue that carries electrical messages throughout the body. It includes the brain and spinal cord, the central nervous system, and nerves that run throughout the body, the peripheral nervous system (see Figure 13.30). To understand how nervous messages can travel so quickly, you need to know more about nerve cells. 
Nerve  Cells 	  Although the nervous system is very complex, nervous tissue consists of just two basic types of nerve cells: neurons and glial cells. Neurons are the structural and functional units of the nervous system. They transmit electrical 
The human nervous system includes the 	  brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) and nerves that run throughout the body (peripheral nervous system). signals, called nerve impulses. Glial cells provide support for neurons. For example, they provide neurons with nutrients and other materials. 
Neuron  Structure 	  As shown in Figure 13.31, a neuron consists of three basic parts: the cell body, dendrites, and axon. You can watch an animation of the parts of a neuron at this link: URL . • The cell body contains the nucleus and other cell organelles. • Dendrites extend from the cell body and receive nerve impulses from other neurons. • The axon is a long extension of the cell body that transmits nerve impulses to other cells. The axon branches at the end, forming axon terminals. These are the points where the neuron communicates with other cells. The neuron is discussed at URL (6:13). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
The structure of a neuron allows it 	  to rapidly transmit nerve impulses to other cells. 
Myelin  Sheath 	  The axon of many neurons has an outer layer called a myelin sheath (see Figure 13.31). Myelin is a lipid produced by a type of a glial cell known as a Schwann cell. The myelin sheath acts like a layer of insulation, similar to the plastic that encases an electrical cord. Regularly spaced nodes, or gaps, in the myelin sheath allow nerve impulses to skip along the axon very rapidly. 
Types of  Neurons 	  Neurons are classified based on the direction in which they carry nerve impulses. • Sensory neurons carry nerve impulses from tissues and organs to the spinal cord and brain. • Motor neurons carry nerve impulses from the brain and spinal cord to muscles and glands (see Figure 13.32). • Interneurons carry nerve impulses back and forth between sensory and motor neurons. 
Summary 	  • Neurons are the structural and functional units of the nervous system. They consist of a cell body, dendrites, and axon. • Neurons transmit nerve impulses to other cells. • Types of neurons include sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons.

How does a nervous system signal move from one cell to the next? It literally jumps by way of a chemical transmitter. Notice the two cells are not connected, but separated by a small gap. The synapse. The space between a neuron and the next cell. 
Nerve  Impulses 	  Nerve impulses are electrical in nature. They result from a difference in electrical charge across the plasma membrane of a neuron. How does this difference in electrical charge come about? The answer involves ions, which are electrically charged atoms or molecules. 
Resting  Potential 	  When a neuron is not actively transmitting a nerve impulse, it is in a resting state, ready to transmit a nerve impulse. During the resting state, the sodium-potassium pump maintains a difference in charge across the cell membrane (see Figure 13.33). It uses energy in ATP to pump positive sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell and potassium ions (K+) into the cell. As a result, the inside of the neuron is negatively charged compared to the extracellular fluid surrounding the neuron. This is due to many more positively charged ions outside the cell compared to inside the cell. This difference in electrical charge is called the resting potential. The sodium-potassium pump maintains the resting potential of a neuron. 
Action  Potential 	  A nerve impulse is a sudden reversal of the electrical charge across the membrane of a resting neuron. The reversal of charge is called an action potential. It begins when the neuron receives a chemical signal from another cell. The signal causes gates in sodium ion channels to open, allowing positive sodium ions to flow back into the cell. As a result, the inside of the cell becomes positively charged compared to the outside of the cell. This reversal of charge ripples down the axon very rapidly as an electric current (see Figure 13.34). You can watch a detailed animation of an action potential at this link: URL . 
An action potential speeds along an axon 	  in milliseconds. In neurons with myelin sheaths, ions flow across the membrane only at the nodes between sections of myelin. As a result, the action potential jumps along the axon membrane from node to node, rather than spreading smoothly along the entire membrane. This increases the speed at which it travels. 
The action potential is discussed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk Qt Rec2464 (18:53) and http://www.youtu 	  be.com/watch?v=ikFUv-gdNLQ (11:06). Click image to the left or use the URL below.

The  Synapse 	  The place where an axon terminal meets another cell is called a synapse. The axon terminal and other cell are separated by a narrow space known as a synaptic cleft (see Figure 13.35). When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, the axon terminal releases molecules of a chemical called a neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter molecules travel across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the membrane of the other cell. If the other cell is a neuron, this starts an action potential in the other cell. You can view animations of neurotransmission at a synapse at the following links: • URL • URL . The synapse is further discussed at URL . At a synapse, neurotransmitters are released by the axon terminal. They bind with receptors on the other cell.

The human brain. The "control center." What does it control? Practically everything. From breathing and heartbeat to reasoning, memory, and language. And it is the main part of the central nervous system. 
Central  Nervous  System 	  The nervous system has two main divisions: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system (see see an overview of the central nervous system at this link: URL . 
The  Brain 	  The brain is the most complex organ of the human body and the control center of the nervous system. It contains an astonishing 100 billion neurons! The brain controls such mental processes as reasoning, imagination, memory, and language. It also interprets information from the senses. In addition, it controls basic physical processes such as breathing and heartbeat. 
The two main divisions of 	  the human nervous system are the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system has additional divisions. 
This diagram shows the components of 	  the central nervous system. The brain has three major parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem. These parts are shown in Figure 13.38 and described in this section. For a video of the parts of the brain and their functions, go to this link: URL eachers.tv/video/13838 . You can also take interactive animated tours of the brain at these links: • URL • URL . 
In this drawing, assume you are looking 	  at the left side of the head. This is how the brain would appear if you could look underneath the skull. • The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It controls conscious functions such as reasoning, language, sight, touch, and hearing. It is divided into two hemispheres, or halves. The hemispheres are very similar but not identical to one another. They are connected by a thick bundle of axons deep within the brain. Each hemisphere is further divided into the four lobes shown in Figure 13.39. • The cerebellum is just below the cerebrum. It coordinates body movements. Many nerve pathways link the cerebellum with motor neurons throughout the body. • The brain stem is the lowest part of the brain. It connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord and passes nerve impulses between the brain and spinal cord. It also controls unconscious functions such as heart rate and breathing. See Basic Brain Anatomy at URL for additional material. 
Spinal  Cord 	  The spinal cord is a thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue that extends from the brainstem and continues down the center of the back to the pelvis. It is protected by the vertebrae, which encase it. The spinal cord serves as an information superhighway, passing messages from the body to the brain and from the brain to the body. 
Humanoid  Robot  Brains 	  The smartest people in the world have spent millions of dollars on developing high-tech robots. But even though technology has come a long way, these humanoid robots are nowhere close to having the "brain" and motor control of Each hemisphere of the cerebrum consists of four parts, called lobes. Each lobe is associated with particular brain functions. Just one function of each lobe is listed here. a human. Why is that?

Summary 	  • The central nervous includes the brain and spinal cord. • The brain is the control center of the nervous system. It controls virtually all mental and physical processes. • The spinal cord is a long, thin bundle of nervous tissue that passes messages from the body to the brain and from the brain to the body.

Explain why. • Describe the structure and function of the peripheral nervous system. • Compare the sensory division to the motor division. • Explain the role of the somatic nervous system. • Distinguish the sympathetic division from the parasympathetic division. How does the signal get to your toes? If the brain controls practically everything, how does the signal get to your toes? Or your legs? Or arms? By way of the peripheral nervous system, or all the nerves shown here other than the brain and spinal cord. Notice how they go everywhere. 
Peripheral  Nervous  System 	  The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of all the nervous tissue that lies outside the central nervous system. It is shown in yellow in Figure 13.40. It is connected to the central nervous system by nerves. A nerve is a cable-like bundle of axons. Some nerves are very long. The longest human nerve is the sciatic nerve. It runs from the spinal cord in the lower back down the left leg all the way to the toes of the left foot. Like the nervous system as a whole, the peripheral nervous system also has two divisions: the sensory division and the motor division. • The sensory division of the PNS carries sensory information from the body to the central nervous system. • The motor division of the PNS carries nerve impulses from the central nervous system to muscles and glands throughout the body. The nerve impulses stimulate muscles to contract and glands to secrete hormones. The motor division of the peripheral nervous system is further divided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The nerves of the peripheral nervous system are shown in blue in this image. Can you identify the sciatic nerve? 
Somatic  Nervous  System 	  The somatic nervous system (SNS) controls mainly voluntary activities that are under conscious control. It is made up of nerves that are connected to skeletal muscles. Whenever you perform a conscious movement, from signing your name to riding your bike, your somatic nervous system is responsible. The somatic nervous system also controls some unconscious movements, called reflexes. A reflex is a very rapid motor response that is not directed by the brain. In a reflex, nerve impulses travel to and from the spinal cord in a reflex arc, like the one in Figure 13.41. In this example, the person jerks his hand away from the flame without any conscious thought. It happens unconsciously because the nerve impulses bypass the brain. A reflex arc like this one enables involuntary actions. How might reflex responses be beneficial to the organism? 
Autonomic  Nervous  System 	  All other involuntary activities not under conscious control are the responsibility of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Nerves of the ANS are connected to glands and internal organs. They control basic physical functions such as heart rate, breathing, digestion, and sweat production. The autonomic nervous system also has two subdivisions: the sympathetic division and the parasympathetic division. You can watch an animation comparing these two subdivisions at this link: URL . • The sympathetic division deals with emergency situations. It prepares the body for “fight or flight.” Do you get clammy palms or a racing heart when you have to play a solo or give a speech? Nerves of the sympathetic division control these responses. • The parasympathetic division controls involuntary activities that are not emergencies. For example, it controls the organs of your digestive system so they can break down the food you eat. 
Summary 	  • The peripheral nervous system consists of all the nervous tissue that lies outside the central nervous system. It is connected to the central nervous system by nerves. • The peripheral nervous system has several divisions and subdivisions that transmit nerve impulses between the central nervous system and the rest of the body. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Peripheral Nervous System at URL . system controls smooth muscle of the viscera (internal organs) and glands. • Explain how sensory stimuli are perceived and interpreted. • Summarize the roles of the cornea, lens, pupil and retina. • Explain the role of the cochlea and semicircular canals. • Describe the roles of taste receptors, odor receptors, and pressure receptors. Name the five senses. Hearing, sight, taste, touch, and smell. But how do we hear, see, taste, touch and smell? It all has to do, obviously, with the nervous system. 
The  Senses 	  The sensory division of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes several sense organs—the eyes, ears, mouth, nose, and skin. Each sense organ has special cells, called sensory receptors, that respond to a particular type of stimulus. For example, the nose has sensory receptors that respond to chemicals, which we perceive as odors. Sensory receptors send nerve impulses to sensory nerves, which carry the nerve impulses to the central nervous system. The brain then interprets the nerve impulses to form a response. 
Sight 	  Sight is the ability to sense light, and the eye is the organ that senses light. Light first passes through the cornea of the eye, which is a clear outer layer that protects the eye (see Figure 13.42). Light enters the eye through an opening called the pupil. The light then passes through the lens, which focuses it on the retina at the back of the eye. The retina contains light receptor cells. These cells send nerve impulses to the optic nerve, which carries the impulses to the brain. The brain interprets the impulses and “tells” us what we are seeing. To learn more about the eye and the sense of sight, you can go to the link below. URL 
Hearing 	  Hearing is the ability to sense sound waves, and the ear is the organ that senses sound. Sound waves enter the auditory canal and travel to the eardrum (see Figure 13.43). They strike the eardrum and make it vibrate. The vibrations then travel through several other structures inside the ear and reach the cochlea. The cochlea is a coiled tube filled with liquid. The liquid moves in response to the vibrations, causing tiny hair cells lining the cochlea to bend. In response, the hair cells send nerve impulses to the auditory nerve, which carries the impulses to the brain. The brain interprets the impulses and “tells” us what we are hearing. 
The eye is the organ that senses light and 	  allows us to see. 
The ear is the organ that senses sound 	  waves and allows us to hear. 
It also 	  senses body position so we can keep our balance. 
Balance 	  The ears are also responsible for the sense of balance. Balance is the ability to sense and maintain body position. The semicircular canals inside the ear (see Figure 13.43) contain fluid that moves when the head changes position. Tiny hairs lining the semicircular canals sense movement of the fluid. In response, they send nerve impulses to the vestibular nerve, which carries the impulses to the brain. The brain interprets the impulses and sends messages to the peripheral nervous system. This system maintains the body’s balance by triggering contractions of skeletal muscles as needed. 
Taste and  Smell 	  Taste and smell are both abilities to sense chemicals. Like other sense receptors, both taste receptors and odor receptors send nerve impulses to the brain, and the brain “tells” use what we are tasting or smelling. Taste receptors are found in tiny bumps on the tongue called taste buds (see Figure 13.44). There are separate taste receptors for sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and meaty tastes. The meaty taste is called umami. You can learn more about taste receptors and the sense of taste by watching the animation at the following link: URL /humanbody/body/factfiles/taste/taste_ani_f5.swf . 
Taste buds on the tongue contain taste 	  receptor cells. Odor receptors line the passages of the nose (see Figure 13.45). They sense chemicals in the air. In fact, odor receptors can sense hundreds of different chemicals. Did you ever notice that food seems to have less taste when you have a stuffy nose? This occurs because the sense of smell contributes to the sense of taste, and a stuffy nose interferes with the ability to smell. 
Touch 	  Touch is the ability to sense pressure. Pressure receptors are found mainly in the skin. They are especially concentrated on the tongue, lips, face, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. Some touch receptors sense differences in temperature or pain. How do pain receptors help maintain homeostasis? (Hint: What might happen if we couldn’t feel pain?) See URL for a summary. (0.51). 
Odor receptors.  Odor receptors and their 	  associated nerves (in yellow) line the top of the nasal passages. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Why  I do  Science 	  If you kids don’t like broccoli, it may not be their fault, it may just be their genes talking. Dr. Danielle Reed is a geneticist working to understand the genetics of taste. Can all people detect the same tastes? No. Why not? It has to do with a person’s genes. People may actually taste foods differently. See URL for additional information.

Is coffee a drug? Maybe. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it is bad for you. Looks tasty, though. Other than taste, why do many people have a cup of coffee in the morning? Does it help them wake up? For many people, it does. Why? The caffeine in the coffee stimulates the central nervous system. This drug is one of the milder drugs affecting the nervous system. 
Drugs and the  Nervous  System 	  A drug is any chemical that affects the body’s structure or function. Many drugs, including both legal and illegal drugs, are psychoactive drugs. This means that they affect the central nervous system, generally by influencing the transmission of nerve impulses. For example, some psychoactive drugs mimic neurotransmitters. At the link below, you can watch an animation showing how psychoactive drugs affect the brain. URL animation/neuron-main.html 
Examples of  Psychoactive  Drugs 	  Caffeine is an example of a psychoactive drug. It is found in coffee and many other products (see Table 13.3). Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. Like other stimulant drugs, it makes you feel more awake and alert. Other psychoactive drugs include alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. Each has a different effect on the central nervous system. Alcohol, for example, is a depressant. It has the opposite effects of a stimulant like caffeine.

Drug  Abuse and  Addiction 	  Caffeine Content (mg) Psychoactive drugs may bring about changes in mood that users find desirable, so the drugs may be abused. Drug abuse is use of a drug without the advice of a medical professional and for reasons not originally intended. Continued use of a psychoactive drug may lead to drug addiction, in which the drug user is unable to stop using the drug. Over time, a drug user may need more of the drug to get the desired effect. This can lead to drug overdose and death.

Ever had a headache that just won’t go away? We all get headaches. Headaches are a relatively minor problem associated with the nervous system. But what about more serious issues of the nervous system? As you can probably imagine, these can be extremely serious. 
Disorders of the  Nervous  System 	  There are several different types of problems that can affect the nervous system. • Vascular disorders involve problems with blood flow. For example, a stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to part of the brain. Brain cells die quickly if their oxygen supply is cut off. This may cause paralysis and loss of other normal functions, depending on the part of the brain that is damaged. • Nervous tissue may become infected by microorganisms. Meningitis, for example, is caused by a viral or bacterial infection of the tissues covering the brain. This may cause the brain to swell and lead to brain damage and death. • Encephalitis is a brain infection most often caused by viruses. The immune system tries to fight off a brain infection, just as it tries to fight off other infections. But sometimes this can do more harm than good. The immune system’s response may cause swelling in the brain. With no room to expand, the brain pushes against the skull. This may injure the brain and even cause death. Medicines can help fight some viral infections of the brain, but not all infections. • Brain or spinal cord injuries may cause paralysis and other disabilities. Injuries to peripheral nerves can cause localized pain or numbness. • Abnormal brain functions can occur for a variety of reasons. Examples include headaches, such as migraine headaches, and epilepsy, in which seizures occur. • Nervous tissue may degenerate, or break down. Alzheimer’s disease is an example of this type of disorder, as is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS. ALS is also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. It leads to a gradual loss of higher brain functions. For a detailed video discussion of Alzheimer’s disease see the visualMD.com at URL . • In addition to ALS and Alzheimer’s disease, other serious nervous system diseases include multiple sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. These diseases rarely, if ever, occur in young people. Their causes and symptoms are listed below ( Table below ). The diseases have no known cure, but medicines may help control their symptoms.

Tourette’s Syndrome down. What symptoms might this cause? Why? • Define hormone. • Explain the role of the hypothalamus. • Summarize the role of the pituitary gland and its hormones. • List the glands of the endocrine system and their effects. What’s a hormone? This messenger pigeon is delivering a letter, making sure it gets to where it needs to go. 
It could be said that 	  hormones are biological messengers, and they originate from the endocrine system. The nervous system isn’t the only message-relaying system of the human body. The endocrine system also carries messages. The endocrine system is a system of glands that release chemical messenger molecules into the bloodstream. The messenger molecules are hormones. Hormones act slowly compared with the rapid transmission of electrical messages by the nervous system. They must travel through the bloodstream to the cells they affect, and this takes time. On the other hand, because endocrine hormones are released into the bloodstream, they travel throughout the body. As a result, endocrine hormones can affect many cells and have body-wide effects. 
Glands of the  Endocrine  System 	  The major glands of the endocrine system are shown in Figure 13.46. You can access a similar, animated endocrine system chart at the link below. URL 
Hypothalamus 	  The hypothalamus is actually part of the brain (see Figure 13.47), but it also secretes hormones. Some of its hormones “tell” the pituitary gland either to secrete or to stop secreting its hormones. In this way, the hypothalamus provides a link between the nervous and endocrine systems. The hypothalamus also produces hormones that directly regulate body processes. These hormones travel to the pituitary gland, which stores them until they are needed. The hormones include antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin. 
The glands of the endocrine system are 	  the same in males and females except for the testes, which are found only in males, and ovaries, which are found only in females. • Antidiuretic hormone stimulates the kidneys to conserve water by producing more concentrated urine. • Oxytocin stimulates the contractions of childbirth, among other functions. 
The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are 	  located close together at the base of the brain. 
Pituitary  Gland 	  The pea-sized pituitary gland is attached to the hypothalamus by a thin stalk (see Figure 13.47). It consists of two bulb-like lobes. The posterior (back) lobe stores hormones from the hypothalamus. The anterior (front) lobe secretes pituitary hormones. Several pituitary hormones and their effects are listed in Table 13.5. Most pituitary hormones control other endocrine glands. That’s why the pituitary is often called the “master gland” of the endocrine system.

Other  Endocrine  Glands 	  Other glands of the endocrine system are described below. You can refer to Figure 13.46 to see where they are located. • The thyroid gland is a large gland in the neck. Thyroid hormones increase the rate of metabolism in cells throughout the body. They control how quickly cells use energy and make proteins. • The two parathyroid glands are located behind the thyroid gland. Parathyroid hormone helps keep the level of calcium in the blood within a narrow range. It stimulates bone cells to dissolve calcium in bone matrix and release it into the blood. • The pineal gland is a tiny gland located at the base of the brain. It secretes the hormone melatonin. This hormone controls sleep-wake cycles and several other processes. • The pancreas is located near the stomach. Its hormones include insulin and glucagon. These two hormones work together to control the level of glucose in the blood. Insulin causes excess blood glucose to be taken up by the liver, which stores the glucose as glycogen. Glucagon stimulates the liver to break down glycogen into glucose and release it back into the blood. The pancreas also secretes digestive enzymes into the digestive tract. • The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below. URL • The gonads secrete sex hormones. The male gonads are called testes. They secrete the male sex hormone testosterone. The female gonads are called ovaries. They secrete the female sex hormone estrogen. Sex hormones are involved in the changes of puberty. They also control the production of gametes by the gonads. 
Summary 	  • The endocrine system consists of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream. • The endocrine system is regulated by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which also secretes hormones. • The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland, which is called the “master gland” of the endocrine system because its hormones regulate other endocrine glands. • Other endocrine glands include the thyroid gland and pancreas. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Endocrine System: Facts, Functions and Diseases at URL m.html . • Explain how hormones work. • Distinguish between steroid hormone and non-steroid hormones. • Explain the action of a second messenger. Steroid hormones. How do they work? As hormones, they are the messengers of the endocrine system. Obviously they must change something in the cell. 
How  Hormones  Work 	  Hormones are the messenger molecules of the endocrine system. Endocrine hormones travel throughout the body in the blood. However, each hormone affects only certain cells, called target cells. A target cell is the type of cell on which a hormone has an effect. A target cell is affected by a particular hormone because it has receptor proteins that are specific to that hormone. A hormone travels through the bloodstream until it finds a target cell with a matching receptor it can bind to. When the hormone binds to a receptor, it causes a change within the cell. Exactly how this works depends on whether the hormone is a steroid hormone or a non-steroid hormone. At the link below, you can watch an animation that shows how both types of hormones work. URL bject.aspx?ID=AP13704 Hormones are discussed at URL (2:28). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Steroid  Hormones 	  Steroid hormones are made of lipids, such as phospholipids and cholesterol. They are fat soluble, so they can diffuse across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind with receptors in the cytoplasm of the cell (see Figure 13.48). The steroid hormone and receptor form a complex that moves into the nucleus and influences the expression of genes, essentially acting as a transcription factor. Examples of steroid hormones include cortisol and sex hormones. 
A steroid hormone crosses the plasma 	  membrane of a target cell and binds with a receptor inside the cell. 
Non- Steroid  Hormones 	  Non-steroid hormones are made of amino acids. They are not fat soluble, so they cannot diffuse across the plasma membrane of target cells. Instead, a non-steroid hormone binds to a receptor on the cell membrane (see Figure molecule, called the second messenger, which influences processes inside the cell. Most endocrine hormones are non-steroid hormones, including insulin and thyroid hormones. A non-steroid hormone binds with a receptor on the plasma membrane of a target cell. Then, a secondary messenger affects cell processes. 
Summary 	  • Hormones work by binding to protein receptors either inside target cells or on their plasma membranes. • The binding of a steroid hormone forms a hormone-receptor complex that affects gene expression in the nucleus of the target cell. • The binding of a non-steroid hormone activates a second messenger that affects processes within the target cell. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • The Actions of Hormones at URL . • Describe feedback mechanisms that regulate hormone secretion. • Explain a negative feedback loop. • Distinguish between a negative feedback loop and a positive feedback loop. On or off? Hormones alter conditions inside the cell, usually in response to a stimulus. That means they are activated at specific times. So they must be turned on and then turned back off. What turns these hormones and their responses on or off? 
Hormone  Regulation:  Feedback  Mechanisms 	  Hormones control many cell activities, so they are very important for homeostasis. But what controls the hormones themselves? Most hormones are regulated by feedback mechanisms. A feedback mechanism is a loop in which a product feeds back to control its own production. Most hormone feedback mechanisms involve negative feedback loops. Negative feedback keeps the concentration of a hormone within a narrow range. 
Negative  Feedback 	  Negative feedback occurs when a product feeds back to decrease its own production. This type of feedback brings things back to normal whenever they start to become too extreme. The thyroid gland is a good example of this type of regulation. It is controlled by the negative feedback loop shown in Figure 13.50. You can also watch an animation of this process at the link below. URL The thyroid gland is regulated by a negative feedback loop. The loop includes the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in addition to the thyroid. Here’s how thyroid regulation works. The hypothalamus secretes thyrotropin-releasing hormone, or TRH. TRH stimulates the pituitary gland to produce thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH. TSH, in turn, stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete its hormones. When the level of thyroid hormones is high enough, the hormones feedback to stop the hypothalamus from secreting TRH and the pituitary from secreting TSH. Without the stimulation of TSH, the thyroid gland stops secreting its hormones. Soon, the level of thyroid hormone starts to fall too low. What do you think happens next? This process is discussed at URL (1:35). Click image to the left or use the URL below. Negative feedback also controls insulin secretion by the pancreas. You can interact with a feedback loop of this process at the link below. URL llTopic=1 
Positive feedback 	  Positive feedback occurs when a product feeds back to increase its own production. This causes conditions to become increasingly extreme. An example of positive feedback is milk production by a mother for her baby. As the baby suckles, nerve messages from the nipple cause the pituitary gland to secrete prolactin. Prolactin, in turn, stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk, so the baby suckles more. This causes more prolactin to be secreted and more milk to be produced. This example is one of the few positive feedback mechanisms in the human body. What do you think would happen if milk production by the mammary glands was controlled by negative feedback instead? 
Summary 	  • Most hormones are controlled by negative feedback, in which the hormone feeds back to decrease its own production. This type of feedback brings things back to normal whenever they start to become too extreme. • Positive feedback is much less common because it causes conditions to become increasingly extreme. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Hormonal Regulation at URL . body? negative feedback? thyroid hormone in her blood. What is TSH?

How tall can a person become? This may be an exaggeration, but the world’s tallest person, Robert Pershing Wadlow, stood almost nine feet tall when he died at the age of 22. Is growing that tall due to a problem with the endocrine system? 
Endocrine  System  Disorders 	  Diseases of the endocrine system are relatively common. An endocrine disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough hormone. When too much hormone is secreted, it is called hypersecretion. When not enough hormone is secreted, it is called hyposecretion. 
Hypersecretion 	  Hypersecretion by an endocrine gland is often caused by a tumor. For example, a tumor of the pituitary gland can cause hypersecretion of growth hormone. If this occurs in childhood, it results in very long arms and legs and abnormally tall stature by adulthood. The condition is commonly known as gigantism (see Figure 13.51). See Giants Part 1 Pituitary Gigantism and Acromegaly at URL for information about pituitary giants. 
Hypersecretion of growth hormone leads to abnormal growth, often called 	  gigantism. 
Hyposecretion 	  Destruction of hormone-secreting cells of a gland may result in not enough of a hormone being secreted. This occurs in type 1 diabetes. In this case, the body’s own immune system attacks and destroys cells of the pancreas that secrete insulin, making type 1 diabetes an autoimmune disease. A person with type 1 diabetes must frequently monitor the level of glucose in the blood (see Figure 13.52). If the level of blood glucose is too high, insulin is injected to bring it under control. If it is too low, a small amount of sugar is consumed. 
To measure the level of glucose in the 	  blood, a drop of blood is placed on a test strip, which is read by a meter. 
Hormone  Resistance 	  In some cases, an endocrine gland secretes a normal amount of hormone, but target cells do not respond to the hormone. Often, this is because target cells have become resistant to the hormone. Type 2 diabetes is an example of this type of endocrine disorder. In type 2 diabetes, body cells do not respond to normal amounts of insulin. As a result, cells do not take up glucose and the amount of glucose in the blood becomes too high. This type of diabetes is usually treated with medication and diet. The addition of extra insulin to the treatment can help some patients. 
Summary 	  • Endocrine system disorders usually involve the secretion of too much or not enough hormone. For example, a tumor of the adrenal gland may lead to excessive secretion of growth hormone, which causes gigantism. • In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not secrete enough insulin, which causes high levels of glucose in the blood.

What’s the most active muscle in the body? The human heart. An absolutely remarkable organ. Obviously, its main function is to pump blood throughout the body. And it does this extremely well. On average, this muscular organ will beat about 100,000 times in one day and about 35 million times in a year. During an average lifetime, the human heart will beat more than 2.5 billion times. 
The  Circulatory  System 	  The circulatory system can be compared to a system of interconnected, one-way roads that range from superhighways to back alleys. Like a network of roads, the job of the circulatory system is to allow the transport of materials from one place to another. As described in Figure 13.53, the materials carried by the circulatory system include hormones, oxygen, cellular wastes, and nutrients from digested food. Transport of all these materials is necessary to maintain homeostasis of the body. The main components of the circulatory system are the heart, blood vessels, and blood. 
The  Heart 	  The heart is a muscular organ in the chest. It consists mainly of cardiac muscle tissue and pumps blood through blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions. The heart has four chambers, as shown in Figure 13.54: two 
The function of the circulatory system is 	  to move materials around the body. upper atria (singular, atrium) and two lower ventricles. Valves between chambers keep blood flowing through the heart in just one direction. 
Blood  Flow  Through the  Heart 	  Blood flows through the heart in two separate loops, which are indicated by the arrows in Figure above. You can think of them as a "left side loop" and a "right side loop." The right side of the heart collects oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps the blood to the lungs. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen obtained by the blood. The left side of the heart carries the oxygen-rich blood back from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. The blood delivers oxygen to the body’s cells, returning the oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. You can watch an animation of the heart pumping blood at this link: URL /hhw/hhw_pumping.html . ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs. 
The chambers of the heart and the valves 	  between them are shown here. which pumps it to the body. 
Heartbeat 	  Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle contracts without stimulation by the nervous system. Instead, specialized cardiac muscle cells send out electrical impulses that stimulate the contractions. As a result, the atria and ventricles normally contract with just the right timing to keep blood pumping efficiently through the heart. You can watch an animation to see how this happens at this link: URL html . 
Summary 	  • The heart contracts rhythmically to pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. • Specialized cardiac muscle cells trigger the contractions. Use these resources to answer the questions that follow. • How the Heart Works at URL . • Heart Anatomy at URL . • List and describe the three major types of blood vessels. • Describe the roles of the aorta, superior vena cava, and inferior vena cava. • Describe the role of the blood vessels in maintaining homeostasis. How does blood travel around the body? Through blood vessels, of course. This image of veins is from William Harvey’s (1578-1657) Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus. Harvey was the first to describe in detail the systemic circulation and properties of blood being pumped to the brain and body by the heart. 
Blood  Vessels 	  Blood vessels form a network throughout the body to transport blood to all the body cells. There are three major types of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. All three are shown in Figure 13.55 and described below. • Arteries are muscular blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. They have thick walls that can withstand the pressure of blood being pumped by the heart. Arteries generally carry oxygen-rich blood. The largest artery is the aorta, which receives blood directly from the heart. • Veins are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart. This blood is no longer under much pressure, so many veins have valves that prevent backflow of blood. Veins generally carry deoxygenated blood. The largest vein is the inferior vena cava, which carries blood from the lower body to the heart. The superior vena cava brings blood back to the heart from the upper body. • Capillaries are the smallest type of blood vessels. They connect very small arteries and veins. The exchange of gases and other substances between cells and the blood takes place across the extremely thin walls of capillaries. 
Blood vessels include arteries, veins, and 	  capillaries. 
Blood  Vessels and  Homeostasis 	  Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure 13.56). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels. Constriction and dilation allow the circulatory system to change the amount of blood flowing to different organs. For example, during a fight-or-flight response, dilation and constriction of blood vessels allow more blood to flow to skeletal muscles and less to flow to digestive organs. Dilation of blood vessels in the skin allows more blood to flow to the body surface so the body can lose heat. Constriction of these blood vessels has the opposite effect and helps conserve body heat. 
Blood  Vessels and  Blood  Pressure 	  The force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels is called blood pressure. Blood pressure is highest in arteries and lowest in veins. When you have your blood pressure checked, it is the blood pressure in arteries that is measured. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a serious health risk but can often be controlled with lifestyle changes or medication. You can learn more about hypertension by watching the animation at this link: URL . When a blood vessel constricts, blood can flow through it. less

Why can’t you take your pulse by pressing your fingers against a vein? • Outline pathways of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. How does oxygen get into the blood? The main function of the circulatory system is to pump blood carrying oxygen around the body. But how does that oxygen get into the blood in the first place? You may already know that this occurs in the lungs. So the blood must also be pumped to the lungs, and this happens separately from the rest of the body. 
Pulmonary and  Systemic  Circulations 	  The circulatory system actually consists of two separate systems: pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation. You can watch animations of both systems at the following link. URL 
Pulmonary  Circulation 	  Pulmonary circulation is the part of the circulatory system that carries blood between the heart and lungs (the term “pulmonary” means “of the lungs”). It is illustrated in Figure 13.57. Deoxygenated blood leaves the right ventricle through pulmonary arteries, which transport it to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood gives up carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium of the heart through pulmonary veins. 
The pulmonary circulation carries blood 	  between the heart and lungs. 
Systemic  Circulation 	  Systemic circulation is the part of the circulatory system that carries blood between the heart and body. 
It is 	  illustrated in Figure 13.58. Oxygenated blood leaves the left ventricle through the aorta. The aorta and other arteries transport the blood throughout the body, where it gives up oxygen and picks up carbon dioxide. The deoxygenated blood then returns to the right atrium through veins.

Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Systemic and Pulmonary Circulation at URL tomy-and-physiology-textbook/the-cardiovascular-system-18/circulation-and-heart-valves-173/systemic-andpulmonary-circulation-872-1153/ . The systemic circulation carries blood between the heart and body. • Define cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and heart attack. • List risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Don’t smoke, eat healthy, and exercise. Why? Normally blood needs to flow freely through our arteries. Plaque in an artery can restrict the flow of blood. As you can probably imagine, this is not an ideal situation. And eating right, exercising, and not smoking can help keep your arteries healthy. 
Cardiovascular  Disease 	  Diseases of the heart and blood vessels, called cardiovascular diseases (CVD), are very common. The leading cause of CVD is atherosclerosis. 
Atherosclerosis 	  Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque inside arteries (see Figure 13.59). Plaque consists of cell debris, cholesterol, and other substances. Factors that contribute to plaque buildup include a high-fat diet and smoking. As plaque builds up, it narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow. You can watch an animation about atherosclerosis at these links: URL and URL . Atherosclerosis normally begins in late childhood and is typically found in most major arteries. It does not usually have any early symptoms. Causes of atherosclerosis include a high-fat diet, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. Atherosclerosis becomes a threat to health when the plaque buildup prevents blood circulation in the heart 
The fatty material 	  inside the artery on the right is plaque. Notice how much narrower the artery has become. Less blood can flow through it than the normal artery. or the brain. A blocked blood vessel in the heart can cause a heart attack. Blockage of the circulation in the brain can cause a stroke. Ways to prevent atherosclerosis include eating healthy foods, getting plenty of exercise and not smoking. A diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol can raise your body’s cholesterol levels, which can lead to increased plaque in your arteries. Cholesterol and saturated fat are found mostly in animal products, such as meat, eggs, milk and other dairy products. 
Coronary  Heart  Disease 	  Atherosclerosis of arteries that supply the heart muscle is called coronary heart disease. This disease may or may not have symptoms, such as chest pain. As the disease progresses, there is an increased risk of heart attack. A heart attack occurs when the blood supply to part of the heart muscle is blocked and cardiac muscle fibers die. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death of adults in the United States. The image below shows the way in which a blocked coronary artery can cause a heart attack. The loss of oxygen to the heart muscle cause that part of the tissue to die. Maybe one day, stem cell therapy will allow for the replacement of the dead cells with new cardiac muscle cells. See the Massachusetts Institute of Technology video The Heart of the Matter: An Introduction to Engineering Heart Tissue at URL for information on the development of new blood vessels. 
A blockage in a coronary artery stops 	  oxygen from getting to part of the heart muscle, so areas of the heart that depend on the blood flow from the blocked artery are starved of oxygen. 
Stroke 	  Atherosclerosis in the arteries of the brain can also lead to a stroke. A stroke is a loss of brain function due to a blockage of the blood supply to the brain. Risk factors for stroke include old age, high blood pressure, having a previous stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, and smoking. The best way to reduce the risk of stroke is to have low blood pressure. 
Preventing  Cardiovascular  Disease 	  Many factors may increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease and other CVDs. The risk of CVDs increases with age and is greater in males than females at most ages. Having a close relative with CVD also increases the risk. These factors cannot be controlled, but other risk factors can, including smoking, lack of exercise, and highfat diet. By making healthy lifestyle choices, you can reduce your risk of developing CVD. 
Summary 	  • A disease that affects the heart or blood vessels is called a cardiovascular disease (CVD). • The leading cause of CVD is atherosclerosis, or the buildup of plaque inside arteries. • Healthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of developing CVD.

What exactly is blood? All your cells need oxygen, as oxygen is the final electron acceptor during cellular respiration. How do they get this oxygen? From blood. Blood cells flow through the vessels of the human circulatory system. But what exactly is blood? It does transport oxygen, but also has other functions. 
Blood 	  Blood is a fluid connective tissue. It circulates throughout the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. Blood in arteries carries oxygen and nutrients to all the body’s cells. Blood in veins carries carbon dioxide and other wastes away from the cells to be excreted. Blood also defends the body against infection, repairs body tissues, transports hormones, and controls the body’s pH. 
Composition of  Blood 	  The fluid part of blood is called plasma. It is a watery golden-yellow liquid that contains many dissolved substances and blood cells. Types of blood cells in plasma include red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (see Figure link: URL . Cells in blood include red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. • The trillions of red blood cells in blood plasma carry oxygen. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein with iron that binds with oxygen. Red blood cells are made in the marrow of long bones, rib bones, the skull, and the vertebrae. These cells survive for about 120 days, and then they are destroyed. Mature red blood cells lack a nucleus and other organelles, allowing for more hemoglobin, and therefore more oxygen to be carried by each cell. • White blood cells are generally larger than red blood cells but far fewer in number. They defend the body against foreign bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. For example, white blood cells called phagocytes swallow and destroy microorganisms and debris in the blood, neutrophils engulf bacteria and other parasites, and lymphocytes fight infections caused by bacteria and viruses. • Platelets are cell fragments involved in blood clotting. They stick to tears in blood vessels and to each other, forming a plug at the site of injury. They also release chemicals that are needed for clotting to occur.

Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Blood  Type 	  Blood type is a genetic characteristic associated with the presence or absence of certain molecules, called antigens, on the surface of red blood cells. The most commonly known blood types are the ABO and Rhesus blood types. • ABO blood type is determined by two common antigens, often referred to simply as antigens A and B. A person may have blood type A (only antigen A), B (only antigen B), AB (both antigens), or O (no antigens). • Rhesus blood type is determined by one common antigen. A person may either have the antigen (Rh+) or lack the antigen (Rh−). Blood type is important for medical reasons. A person who needs a blood transfusion must receive blood that is the same type as his or her own. Otherwise, the transfused blood may cause a potentially life-threatening reaction in the patient’s bloodstream. See URL for more information on blood types.

Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • What is Blood? at URL . regardless of their ABO blood type. Explain why. • Define respiration. • Distinguish respiration from cellular respiration. Where does oxygen get into blood? Red blood cells are like trucks that transport cargo on a highway system. Their cargo is oxygen, and the highways are blood vessels. Where do red blood cells pick up their cargo of oxygen? The answer is the lungs. The lungs are organs of the respiratory system. The respiratory system is the body system that brings air containing oxygen into the body and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
Respiration 	  The job of the respiratory system is the exchange of gases between the body and the outside air. This process, called respiration, actually consists of two parts. In the first part, oxygen in the air is drawn into the body and carbon dioxide is released from the body through the respiratory tract. In the second part, the circulatory system delivers the oxygen to body cells and picks up carbon dioxide from the cells in return. The lungs are organs of the respiratory system. It is in the lungs where oxygen is transferred from the respiratory system to the circulatory system. The use of the word “respiration” in relation to gas exchange is different from its use in the term cellular respiration. Recall that cellular respiration is the metabolic process by which cells obtain energy by “burning” glucose. Cellular respiration uses oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. Respiration by the respiratory system supplies the oxygen and takes away the carbon dioxide. An overview of breathing is shown at URL (20:33). Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Air comes in and then where does it go? 
Organs of the  Respiratory  System 	  The organs of the respiratory system that bring air into the body are divided among the upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract. These organs are shown in Figure 13.62. In addition to the lungs, these organs include the pharynx, larynx, trachea and bronchi. The nasal cavity is also part of the respiratory system. The nose and nasal cavity filter, warm, and moisten the air we inhale. Hairs and mucus produced in the nose trap particles in the air and prevent them from reaching the lungs.

The bronchioles lead to alveoli, the sites of gas exchange.

Grapes. Why? What do these have in common with a breath of air? Below are the parts of the lungs where oxygen moves from the lungs into the blood. If the alveoli below were purple, they could resemble a bunch of grapes. Of course, as the alveoli are in the lungs, they must be very small to provide enough area for the exchange of gases. In fact, there are about 300 million alveoli in the adult lung. 
Journey of a  Breath of  Air 	  Take in a big breath of air through your nose. As you inhale, you may feel the air pass down your throat and notice your chest expand. Now exhale and observe the opposite events occurring. Inhaling and exhaling may seem like simple actions, but they are just part of the complex process of respiration, which includes these four steps: 
Ventilation 	  Respiration begins with ventilation. This is the process of moving air in and out of the lungs. The lungs are the organs in which gas exchange takes place between blood and air. • Air enters the respiratory system through the nose. As the air passes through the nasal cavity, mucus and hairs trap any particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened so it won’t harm delicate tissues of the lungs. • Next, the air passes through the pharynx, a long tube that is shared with the digestive system. A flap of connective tissue called the epiglottis closes when food is swallowed to prevent choking. • From the pharynx, air next passes through the larynx, or voice box. The larynx contains vocal cords, which allow us to produce vocal sounds. • After the larynx, air moves into the trachea, or wind pipe. This is a long tube that leads down to the chest. • In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and left bronchi. The bronchi contain cartilage, which prevents them from collapsing. Mucus in the bronchi traps any remaining particles in air. Tiny, hair-like structures called cilia line the bronchi and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body. • Finally, air passes from the bronchi into smaller passages called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in tiny air sacs called alveoli. 
Pulmonary  Gas  Exchange 	  Pulmonary gas exchange is the exchange of gases between inhaled air and the blood. It occurs in the alveoli of the lungs. Alveoli (singular, alveolus) are grape-like clusters surrounded by networks of thin-walled pulmonary capillaries. After you inhale, there is a greater concentration of oxygen in the alveoli than in the blood of the pulmonary capillaries, so oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the blood across the capillaries (see Figure 13.63). Carbon dioxide, in contrast, is more concentrated in the blood of the pulmonary capillaries than in the alveoli, so it diffuses in the opposite direction.

Alveoli are tiny sacs in the lungs where 	  gas exchange takes place. 
Gas  Transport 	  After the blood in the pulmonary capillaries becomes saturated with oxygen, it leaves the lungs and travels to the heart. The heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood into arteries, which carry it throughout the body. Eventually, the blood travels into capillaries that supply body tissues. These capillaries are called peripheral capillaries. 
Peripheral  Gas  Exchange 	  The cells of the body have a much lower concentration of oxygen than does the oxygenated blood in the peripheral capillaries. Therefore, oxygen diffuses from the peripheral capillaries into body cells. Carbon dioxide is produced by cells as a byproduct of cellular respiration, so it is more concentrated in the cells than in the blood of the peripheral capillaries. As a result, carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction. 
Back to the  Lungs 	  The carbon dioxide from body cells travels in the blood from the peripheral capillaries to veins and then to the heart. The heart pumps the blood to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide diffuses into the alveoli. Then, the carbon dioxide passes out of the body through the other structures of the respiratory system, bringing the process of respiration full circle. 
Gas  Exchange and  Homeostasis 	  Gas exchange is needed to provide cells with the oxygen they need for cellular respiration. Cells cannot survive for long without oxygen. Gas exchange is also needed to carry away carbon dioxide waste. Some of the carbon dioxide in the blood dissolves to form carbonic acid, which keeps blood pH within a normal range. Blood pH may become unbalanced if the rate of breathing is too fast or too slow. When breathing is too fast, blood contains too little carbon dioxide and becomes too basic. When breathing is too slow, blood contains too much carbon dioxide and becomes too acidic. Clearly, to maintain proper blood pH, the rate of breathing must be regulated. 
Summary 	  • Respiration begins with ventilation, the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. • Gas exchange in the lungs takes place across the thin walls of pulmonary arteries in tiny air sacs called alveoli. • Oxygenated blood is transported by the circulatory system from lungs to tissues throughout the body. • Gas exchange between blood and body cells occurs across the walls of peripheral capillaries. • Gas exchange helps maintain homeostasis by supplying cells with oxygen, carrying away carbon dioxide waste, and maintaining proper pH of the blood.

Explain why. • Explain how the rate of breathing is regulated. What allows you to take a deep breath? Deep breath in. . . now blow out those candles. We’ve all done that. Taking that deep breath in is an active process. You can usually feel your chest move. Why? Obviously, muscles in your chest are doing the work. 
Regulation of  Breathing 	  To understand how breathing is regulated, you first need to understand how breathing occurs. 
How  Breathing  Occurs 	  Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure 13.64). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon. You can watch an animation showing how breathing occurs at this link: URL vW8PRY . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Breathing depends on contractions of the 	  diaphragm. 
Control of  Breathing 	  The regular, rhythmic contractions of the diaphragm are controlled by the brain stem. It sends nerve impulses to the diaphragm through the autonomic nervous system. The brain stem monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood. If the level becomes too high, it “tells” the diaphragm to contract more often. Breathing speeds up, and the excess carbon dioxide is released into the air. The opposite events occur when the level of carbon dioxide in the blood becomes too low. In this way, breathing keeps blood pH within a narrow range. 
Summary 	  • Breathing occurs due to repeated contractions of a large muscle called the diaphragm. • The rate of breathing is regulated by the brain stem. It monitors the level of carbon dioxide in the blood and triggers faster or slower breathing as needed to keep the level within a narrow range. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • How Is Breathing Regulated? at URL . • Identify diseases of the respiratory system. • Describe triggers for asthma. • Compare pneumonia to emphysema. Does making ATP start with the lungs? The importance of a nice pair of healthy lungs is obvious. We all need oxygen to get into our lungs, so the oxygen can be transferred to the blood, so it can be transported around our body, so each cell can receive its fair share of oxygen, allowing oxygen to serve as the final electron acceptor during the electron transport chain of cellular respiration, allowing the cell to produce lots of ATP. And it all starts with the lungs. 
Diseases of the  Respiratory  System 	  When you have a cold, your nasal passages may become so congested that it’s hard to breathe through your nose. Many other diseases also affect the respiratory system, most of them more serious than the common cold. Some lung diseases, such as lung cancer, can be especially dangerous. The following list includes just a sample of respiratory system diseases. • Asthma is a disease in which the air passages of the lungs periodically become too narrow, often with excessive mucus production. This causes difficulty breathing, coughing, and chest tightness. An asthma attack may be triggered by allergens, strenuous exercise, stress, or other factors. You can learn more about asthma by watching the animation at this link: URL i7NTPk . Click image to the left or use the URL below. • Pneumonia is a disease in which some of the alveoli of the lungs fill with fluid so gas exchange cannot occur. Symptoms usually include coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. Pneumonia may be caused by an infection or injury of the lungs. • Emphysema is a lung disease in which walls of the alveoli break down so less gas can be exchanged in the lungs (see Figure 13.65). This causes shortness of breath. The damage to the alveoli is usually caused by smoking and is irreversible. 
Pneumonia and emphysema are caused 	  by damage to the alveoli of the lungs. 
Causes of  Respiratory  Diseases 	  Many respiratory diseases are caused by pathogens. Certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi are pathogens of the respiratory system. The common cold and flu are caused by viruses. Tuberculosis, whooping cough, and acute bronchitis are caused by bacteria. The pathogens that cause colds, flu, and TB can be passed from person to person by coughing and sneezing. Air pollution is another significant cause of respiratory disease. The quality of the air you breathe can affect the health of your lungs. Asthma, heart and lung diseases, allergies, and several types of cancers are all linked to air quality. Air pollution is not just found outdoors; indoor air pollution can also be responsible for health problems. Smoking is the most significant cause of respiratory disease as well as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Exposure to tobacco smoke by smoking or by breathing air that contains tobacco smoke is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Regular smokers die about 10 years earlier than nonsmokers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes tobacco use as "the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of [early] death worldwide."

Specifically, our energy comes from what? The respiratory and circulatory systems work together to provide cells with the oxygen they need for cellular respiration. Cells also need glucose for cellular respiration. Glucose is a simple sugar that comes from the food we eat. To get glucose from food, digestion must occur. This process is carried out by the digestive system. 
Overview of the  Digestive  System 	  The digestive system consists of organs that break down food and absorb nutrients such as glucose. Organs of the digestive system are shown in Figure 13.66. Most of the organs make up the gastrointestinal tract. The rest of the organs are called accessory organs. 
The  Gastrointestinal  Tract 	  The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a long tube that connects the mouth with the anus. It is more than 9 meters (30 feet) long in adults and includes the esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines. Food enters the mouth, passes through the other organs of the GI tract, and then leaves the body through the anus. At The Digestive Process link below, you can watch an animation that shows what happens to food as it passes through the GI tract. URL . 
The digestive system includes organs 	  from the mouth to the anus. Click image to the left or use the URL below. The organs of the GI tract are lined with mucous membranes that secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. The organs are also covered by layers of muscle that enable peristalsis. Peristalsis is an involuntary muscle contraction that moves rapidly along an organ like a wave (see Figure 13.67). You can watch an animation of peristalsis at this link: URL . 
Peristalsis pushes food through the  	  tract. 
Accessory  Organs of  Digestion 	  Other organs involved in digestion include the liver, gall bladder, and pancreas. They are called accessory organs because food does not pass through them. Instead, they secrete or store substances needed for digestion. 
Functions of the  Digestive  System 	  The digestive system has three main functions: digestion of food, absorption of nutrients, and elimination of solid food waste. Digestion is the process of breaking down food into components the body can absorb. It consists of two types of processes: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. • Mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of chunks of food into smaller pieces. This type of digestion takes place mainly in the mouth and stomach. • Chemical digestion is the chemical breakdown of large, complex food molecules into smaller, simpler nutrient molecules that can be absorbed by the blood. This type of digestion begins in the mouth and stomach but occurs mainly in the small intestine. After food is digested, the resulting nutrients are absorbed. Absorption is the process in which substances pass into the bloodstream, where they can circulate throughout the body. Absorption of nutrients occurs mainly in the small intestine. Any remaining matter from food that cannot be digested and absorbed passes into the large intestine as waste. The waste later passes out of the body through the anus in the process of elimination.

Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • The Digestive System at URL . • Compare mechanical digestion to chemical digestion. • Outline the roles of the mouth, esophagus, and stomach in digestion. What’s the first step in the digestion process? It all starts with the mouth. Food goes in, you chew it up, swallow it, then what happens? The process of turning that food into energy and proteins and other things necessary for life begins. But it all starts with the mouth. 
The  Start of  Digestion:  Mouth to  Stomach 	  Does the sight or aroma of your favorite food make your mouth water? When this happens, you are getting ready for digestion. 
Mouth 	  The mouth is the first digestive organ that food enters. The sight, smell, or taste of food stimulates the release of digestive enzymes by salivary glands inside the mouth. The major salivary enzyme is amylase. It begins the chemical digestion of carbohydrates by breaking down starch into sugar. The mouth also begins the process of mechanical digestion. Sharp teeth in the front of the mouth cut or tear food when you bite into it (see Figure 13.68). Broad teeth in the back of the mouth grind food when you chew. Food is easier to chew because it is moistened by saliva from the salivary glands. The tongue helps mix the food with saliva and also helps you swallow. After you swallow, the chewed food passes into the pharynx. 
Esophagus 	  From the pharynx, the food moves into the esophagus. The esophagus is a long, narrow tube that passes food from the pharynx to the stomach by peristalsis. The esophagus has no other digestive functions. At the end of the Teeth are important for mechanical digestion. esophagus, a muscle called a sphincter controls the entrance to the stomach. The sphincter opens to let food into the stomach and then closes again to prevent food from passing back into the esophagus. 
Stomach 	  The stomach is a sac-like organ in which food is further digested both mechanically and chemically. (To see an animation of how the stomach digests food, go to the link below.) Churning movements of the stomach’s thick, muscular walls complete the mechanical breakdown of food. The churning movements also mix food with digestive fluids secreted by the stomach. One of these fluids is hydrochloric acid. It kills bacteria in food and gives the stomach the low (acidic) pH needed by digestive enzymes that work in the stomach. The main enzyme is pepsin, which chemically digests protein. See URL for additional information. Click image to the left or use the URL below. The stomach stores the partly digested food until the small intestine is ready to receive it. When the small intestine is empty, a sphincter opens to allow the partially digested food to enter the small intestine. The following interactive animation demonstrates the processes that occur in the stomach. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

These projections absorb. Absorb what? Imagine the inside walls of the 23 feet of your small intestine covered with these finger-like projections. Why? What’s their purpose, and why is the small intestine so long? These projections absorb. Absorb what? Minerals and nutrients from food. And the length of the small intestine allows as much of these important substances to be absorbed as possible. 
Digestion and  Absorption:  The  Small  Intestine 	  The small intestine is a narrow tube about 7 meters (23 feet) long in adults. It is the site of most chemical digestion and virtually all absorption. The small intestine consists of three parts: the duodenum, jejunum and ileum (see the opening figure). 
Digestion in the  Small  Intestine 	  The duodenum is the first and shortest part of the small intestine. Most chemical digestion takes place here, and many digestive enzymes are active in the duodenum (see Table 13.6). Some are produced by the duodenum itself. Others are produced by the pancreas and secreted into the duodenum.

Click image to the left or use the URL below. Click image to the left or use the URL below. The liver is an organ of both digestion and excretion. It produces a fluid called bile, which is secreted into the duodenum. Some bile also goes to the gall bladder, a sac-like organ that stores and concentrates bile and then secretes it into the small intestine. In the duodenum, bile breaks up large globules of lipids into smaller globules that are easier for enzymes to break down. Bile also reduces the acidity of food entering from the highly acidic stomach. This is important because digestive enzymes that work in the duodenum need a neutral environment. The pancreas contributes to the neutral environment by secreting bicarbonate, a basic substance that neutralizes acid. 
Absorption in the  Small  Intestine 	  The jejunum is the second part of the small intestine, where most nutrients are absorbed into the blood. As shown in Figure 13.69, the mucous membrane lining the jejunum is covered with millions of microscopic, fingerlike projections called villi (singular, villus). Villi contain many capillaries, and nutrients pass from the villi into the bloodstream through the capillaries. Because there are so many villi, they greatly increase the surface area for absorption. In fact, they make the inner surface of the small intestine as large as a tennis court! You can watch an animation of absorption across intestinal villi at the link below. URL ?v=P1sDOJM65Bc 
This image shows intestinal villi greatly 	  magnified. They are actually microscopic. Click image to the left or use the URL below. The ileum is the third part of the small intestine. A few remaining nutrients are absorbed here. Like the jejunum, the inner surface of the ileum is covered with villi that increase the surface area for absorption.

Liquid to solid. What does this mean? Well, that’s exactly what the large intestine does. It takes the remains of digested food — that is, food in which all the nutrients and minerals have been removed, and prepares it for elimination. 
The  Large  Intestine and  Its  Functions 	  From the small intestine, any remaining food wastes pass into the large intestine. The large intestine is a relatively wide tube that connects the small intestine with the anus. Like the small intestine, the large intestine also consists of three parts: the cecum (or caecum), colon, and rectum. Follow food as it moves through the digestive system at http ://URL (1:37).

The following interactive animation demonstrates how the gastrointestinal (GI) system eliminates waste. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Absorption of  Water and  Elimination of  Wastes 	  The cecum is the first part of the large intestine, where wastes enter from the small intestine. The wastes are in a liquid state. As they pass through the colon, which is the second part of the large intestine, excess water is absorbed. The remaining solid wastes are called feces. Feces accumulate in the rectum, which is the third part of the large intestine. As the rectum fills, the feces become compacted. After a certain amount of feces accumulate, they are eliminated from the body. A sphincter controls the anus and opens to let feces pass through. 
Bacteria in the  Large  Intestine 	  Trillions of bacteria normally live in the large intestine. Most of them are helpful. In fact, we wouldn’t be able to survive without them. Some of the bacteria produce vitamins, which are absorbed by the large intestine. Other functions of intestinal bacteria include: • controlling the growth of harmful bacteria. • breaking down indigestible food components. • producing substances that help prevent colon cancer. • breaking down toxins before they can poison the body.

What’s worse than an upset stomach? You’ve probably had an upset stomach. Most likely it was due to something you ate. But imagine bleeding from your stomach. That’s a little different than your stomach just being upset. Stomach ulcers can be very serious. 
Diseases of the  Digestive  System 	  Many diseases can affect the digestive system. Three of the most common diseases that affect the digestive system are food allergies, ulcers, and heartburn. Foodborne illnesses and food intolerance are also serious issues associated with the digestive system. • Food allergies occur when the immune system reacts to substances in food as though they were harmful “foreign invaders.” Foods that are most likely to cause allergies are pictured in Figure 13.70, and include nuts, eggs, grains and milk. Symptoms of food allergies often include vomiting and diarrhea. Symptoms of food allergies include itching and swelling of the lips and mouth. More serious symptoms include trouble breathing. In some instances, a food allergy can trigger anaphylaxis, which is an extremely severe reaction. Emergency medical treatment is critical for this condition, which left untreated, can lead to death. • Ulcers are sores in the lining of the stomach or duodenum that are usually caused by bacterial infections. They may also be caused by the acidic environment of the stomach. Stomach acids may damage the lining of the

Food and  Nutrients 	  Did you ever hear the saying, “You are what you eat”? It’s not just a saying. It’s actually true. What you eat plays an important role in your health. Eating a variety of the right types of foods promotes good health and provides energy for growth and activity. This is because healthful foods are rich in nutrients. Nutrients are substances the body needs for energy, building materials, and control of body processes. There are six main classes of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, water, vitamins, and minerals. These six classes are categorized as macronutrients or micronutrients depending on how much of them the body needs. 
Macronutrients 	  Nutrients the body needs in relatively large amounts are called macronutrients. They include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and water. All macronutrients except water can be used by the body for energy. (The energy in food is measured in a unit called a Calorie.) The exact amount of each macronutrient that an individual needs depends on many factors, including gender and age. Recommended daily intakes by teens of three macronutrients are shown in Table 13.7. Based on your gender and age, how many grams of proteins should you eat each day? 
Gender/ Age 	  Carbohydrates (g/day) Proteins (g/day) 
Females 14-18 years 	  (includes (L/day) 
Water 	  water in food) • Carbohydrates include sugars, starches, and fiber. Sugars and starches are used by the body for energy. One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 Calories of energy. Fiber, which is found in plant foods, cannot be digested but is needed for good health. Simple carbohydrates are small carbohydrates found in foods such as fruits and milk. These carbohydrates include lactose, fructose and glucose. Complex carbohydrates are much larger molecules. Starch, which is a complex carbohydrate found in vegetables and grains, is made of thousands of glucose units bonded together. • Dietary proteins are broken down during digestion to provide the amino acids needed for protein synthesis. Any extra proteins in the diet not needed for this purpose are used for energy or stored as fat. One gram of proteins provides 4 Calories of energy. Eating protein provides the amino acids for your cells to produce your own antibodies, muscle fibers and enzymes (as well as many other types of proteins). • Lipids provide the body with energy and serve other vital functions, such as protecting neurons and providing the membranes that surround all cells. One gram of lipids provides 9 Calories of energy. You need to eat small amounts of lipids for good health. However, large amounts can be harmful, especially if they contain saturated fatty acids from animal foods. More about saturated and unsaturated fats can be found at Nutrition and Healthy Eating: URL • Water is essential to life because biochemical reactions take place in water. Most people can survive only a few days without water. 
Micronutrients 	  Nutrients the body needs in relatively small amounts are called micronutrients. They include vitamins and minerals. Vitamins are organic compounds that are needed by the body to function properly. Several vitamins are described in Table 13.8. Vitamins play many roles in good health, ranging from maintaining good vision to helping blood clot. Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria in the large intestine. Vitamin D is synthesized by the skin when it is exposed to UV light. Most other vitamins must be obtained from foods like those listed in Table 13.8. 
Function 	  good vision normal nerve function making connective tissue healthy bones and teeth normal cell membranes blood clotting 
Good  Food  Sources 	  carrots, spinach meat, milk oranges, red peppers salmon, eggs vegetable oils, nuts spinach, soybeans Minerals are chemical elements that are essential for body processes. They include calcium, which helps form strong bones and teeth, and potassium, which is needed for normal nerve and muscle function. Good sources of minerals include leafy, green vegetables, whole grains, milk, and meats. Vitamins and minerals do not provide energy, but they are still essential for good health. The necessary amounts can usually be met with balanced eating. However, people who do not eat enough of the right foods may need vitamin or mineral supplements. 
Summary 	  • Nutrients are substances that the body needs for energy, building materials, and control of body processes. • Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and water are nutrients needed in relatively large amounts. • Vitamins and minerals are nutrients needed in much smaller amounts. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Health Education for Life at URL . a. broccoli b. milk c. fruit • Explain balanced eating. • Summarize how to use MyPlate and MyPyramid. • Describe the usefulness of food labels. • Define eating disorder. Why is the good stuff in the smallest segment of this diagram? If you’re like most high school kids, one of the first things you do after school is search for something to eat. And you look for the chips or candy. As this diagram shows, you can eat those. Just not a lot. 
Balanced  Eating 	  Balanced eating is a way of eating that promotes good health. It means eating the right balance of different foods to provide the body with all the nutrients it needs. Fortunately, you don’t need to measure and record the amounts of different nutrients you each day in order to balance your eating. Instead, you can use MyPlate, MyPyramid and food labels. 
My Pyramid and  My Plate 	  MyPyramid shows the relative amounts of foods in different food groups you should eat each day (see Figure customize it for your own gender, age, and activity level. MyPyramid is a visual guideline for balanced eating. Each food group represented by a colored band in MyPyramid is a good source of nutrients. The key in Figure 13.71 shows the food group each band represents. The wider the band, the more you should eat from that food group. The white tip of MyPyramid represents foods that should be eaten only once in a while, such as ice cream and potato chips. They contain few nutrients and may contribute excess Calories to the diet. The figure “walking” up the side of MyPyramid represents the role of physical activity in balanced eating. Regular exercise helps you burn any extra energy that you consume in foods and provides many other health benefits. You should be active for about an hour a day most days of the week. The more active you are, the more energy you will use. In June 2011, the United States Department of Agriculture replaced My Pyramid with MyPlate. MyPlate depicts the relative daily portions of various food groups. See URL for further information. 
My Plate is a visual guideline for balanced 	  eating, replacing MyPyramid in 2011. The following guidelines accompany MyPlate: • Enjoy your food, but eat less. • Avoid oversized portions. • Make half your plate fruits and vegetables. • Make at least half your grains whole grains. • Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk. • Compare sodium in foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals and choose the foods with lower numbers. • Drink water instead of sugary drinks. 
Food  Labels 	  Packaged foods are required by law to carry a nutrition facts label, like the one in Figure 13.73. The labels show the nutrient content and ingredients of foods. Reading labels can help you choose foods that are high in nutrients you need more of (such as proteins) and low in nutrients you need less of (such as fats). 
Nutrition facts labels like this one can help 	  you make good food choices. You should also look for ingredients such as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Avoid foods that contain processed ingredients, such as white flour or white rice. Processing removes nutrients. As a result, processed foods generally supply fewer nutrients than whole foods, even when they have been enriched or fortified with added nutrients. 
Weight  Gain and  Obesity 	  Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. 
Eating  Disorders 	  Some people who are obese have an eating disorder, called binge eating disorder, in which they compulsively overeat. An eating disorder is a mental illness in which people feel compelled to eat in a way that causes physical, mental, and emotional health problems. Other eating disorders include anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Treatments for eating disorders include counseling and medication. 
Summary 	  • Balanced eating promotes good health. • MyPlate, MyPyramid, and food labels are tools that can help you choose the right foods for balanced eating. • Eating too much and exercising too little can lead to weight gain and obesity. • Some people who are obese have an eating disorder. Eating disorders are mental illnesses that require treatment by health professionals.

What do you do with your waste? Toxic waste must be disposed of properly or there can be serious consequences. Now, your waste should not be as colorful or toxic as shown here (if it is, get yourself to a doctor as soon as possible), but it still needs to be removed from you. And that is the role of the excretory system. The excretory system gets rid of waste and excess water. 
Excretion 	  If you exercise on a hot day, you are likely to lose a lot of water in sweat. Then, for the next several hours, you may notice that you do not pass urine as often as normal and that your urine is darker than usual. Do you know why this happens? Your body is low on water and trying to reduce the amount of water lost in urine. The amount of water lost in urine is controlled by the kidneys, the main organs of the excretory system. Excretion is the process of removing wastes and excess water from the body. It is one of the major ways the body maintains homeostasis. Although the kidneys are the main organs of excretion, several other organs also excrete wastes. They include the large intestine, liver, skin, and lungs. All of these organs of excretion, along with the kidneys, make up the excretory system. The roles of the excretory organs other than the kidney are summarized below: • The large intestine eliminates solid wastes that remain after the digestion of food. • The liver breaks down excess amino acids and toxins in the blood. • The skin eliminates excess water and salts in sweat. • The lungs exhale water vapor and carbon dioxide.

Filtering  Blood and  Forming  Urine 	  As shown in Figure 13.76, each nephron acts as a tiny filtering plant. It filters blood and forms urine in the following steps: capillaries of the glomerulus of a nephron, blood pressure forces some of the water and dissolved substances in the blood to cross the capillary walls into Bowman’s capsule. 
In the renal tubule, some of the filtered 	  substances are reabsorbed and returned to the bloodstream. Other substances are secreted into the fluid. fluid that remains in the collecting duct is urine. 
Excretion of  Urine 	  From the collecting ducts of the kidneys, urine enters the ureters, two muscular tubes that move the urine by peristalsis to the bladder (see Figure 13.74). The bladder is a hollow, sac-like organ that stores urine. When the bladder is about half full, it sends a nerve impulse to a sphincter to relax and let urine flow out of the bladder and into the urethra. The urethra is a muscular tube that carries urine out of the body. Urine leaves the body through another sphincter in the process of urination. This sphincter and the process of urination are normally under conscious control. 
Summary 	  • The kidneys filter blood and form urine. They are part of the urinary system, which also includes the ureters, bladder, and urethra. • Each kidney has more than a million nephrons, which are the structural and functional units of the kidney. • Each nephron is like a tiny filtering plant. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. 
The parts of a nephron and their functions 	  are shown in this diagram. • Your Urinary System and How It Works at URL . • Describe the roles of the kidneys. • Explain how the kidneys help maintain homeostasis. • Describe additional roles of the kidneys. Why is a bean-shaped organ so important? Shown above are the isolated kidneys from many little mice. OK, they’re really just kidney beans. But this is what the important kidney looks like. Why is it so important? Your kidneys filter and remove wastes from your blood. 
The  Kidneys 	  The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs just above the waist. They are important organs with many functions in the body, including producing hormones, absorbing minerals, and filtering blood and producing urine. A cross-section of a kidney is shown in Figure 13.77. The function of the kidney is to filter blood and form urine. Urine is the liquid waste product of the body that is excreted by the urinary system. Wastes in the blood come from the normal breakdown of tissues, such as muscles, and from food. The body uses food for energy. After the body has taken the nutrients it needs from food, some of the wastes are absorbed into the blood. If the kidneys did not remove them, these wastes would build up in the blood and damage the body. 
Kidneys and  Nephrons 	  The actual removal of wastes from the blood occurs in tiny units inside the kidneys called nephrons. Nephrons are the structural and functional units of the kidneys. A single kidney may have more than a million nephrons! This is further discussed in the Urinary System concept. 
Each kidney is supplied by a renal artery 	  and renal vein. 
Kidneys and  Homeostasis 	  The kidneys play many vital roles in homeostasis. They work with many other organ systems to do this. For example, they work with the circulatory system to filter blood, and with the urinary system to remove wastes. The kidneys filter all the blood in the body many times each day and produce a total of about 1.5 liters of urine. The kidneys control the amount of water, ions, and other substances in the blood by excreting more or less of them in urine. The kidneys also secrete hormones that help maintain homeostasis. Erythropoietin, for example, is a kidney hormone that stimulates bone marrow to produce red blood cells when more are needed. They also secrete renin, which regulates blood pressure, and calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, which helps maintain calcium for bones. The kidneys themselves are also regulated by hormones. For example, antidiuretic hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates the kidneys to produce more concentrated urine when the body is low on water. 
Other  Functions 	  In addition to filtering blood and producing urine, the kidneys are also involved in maintaining the water level in the body, and regulating red blood cell levels and blood pressure. • As the kidneys are mainly involved in the production of urine, they react to changes in the body’s water level throughout the day. As water intake decreases, the kidneys adjust accordingly and leave water in the body instead of helping remove it through the urine, maintaining the water level in the body. • The kidneys also need constant pressure to filter the blood. When the blood pressure drops too low, the kidneys increase the pressure. One way is by producing angiotensin, a blood vessel-constricting protein. This protein also signals the body to retain sodium and water. Together, the constriction of blood vessels and retention of sodium and water help restore normal blood pressure. • When the kidneys don’t get enough oxygen, they send out a signal in the form of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce more oxygen-carrying red blood cells. 
Summary 	  • The kidneys maintain homeostasis by controlling the amount of water, ions, and other substances in the blood. • Kidneys also secrete hormones that have other homeostatic functions.

How do you block the flow of urine? Kidney stones. Imagine having that travel through your excretory system. OK, that’s not a kidney stone, but you get the idea. Kidney stones can be more than a few millimeters in diameter. Painful? Sometimes extremely uncomfortable. And how does a stone leave the kidney? The same way urine does. 
Kidney  Disease and  Dialysis 	  A person can live a normal, healthy life with just one kidney. However, at least one kidney must function properly to maintain life. Diseases that threaten the health and functioning of the kidneys include kidney stones, infections, and diabetes. • Kidney stones are mineral crystals that form in urine inside the kidney. Kidney stones can form when substances in the urine, such as calcium, oxalate, and phosphorus, become highly concentrated. They may be extremely painful. If they block a ureter, they must be removed so urine can leave the kidney and be excreted. A kidney stone may not cause symptoms until it moves around within your kidney or passes into your ureter. A stone may stay in the kidney or travel down the urinary tract. Kidney stones vary in size. A small stone may pass on its own, causing little or no pain. A larger stone may get stuck along the urinary tract and can block the flow of urine, causing severe pain or bleeding. • Bacterial infections of the urinary tract, especially the bladder, are very common. Bladder infections can be treated with antibiotics prescribed by a doctor. If untreated, they may lead to kidney damage. • Uncontrolled diabetes may damage capillaries of nephrons. As a result, the kidneys lose much of their ability to filter blood. This is called kidney failure. The only cure for kidney failure is a kidney transplant, but it can be treated with dialysis. Dialysis is a medical procedure in which blood is filtered through a machine (see 
A dialysis machine filters a patient’s 	  blood.

Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) need dialysis? Why or why not? • Define immune system. • List common pathogens. • Describe mechanical, chemical, and biological barriers. • Explain the role of mucous membranes. How does your body keep most enemies out? Many would consider the moat around this castle, together with the thick stone castle walls, as the first line of defense. Their role is to keep the enemy out, and protect what’s inside. 
The  First  Line of  Defense 	  Does this organism look like a space alien? A scary creature from a nightmare? In fact, it’s a 1-cm long worm that lives in the human body and causes serious harm. It enters the body through a hair follicle of the skin when it’s in a much smaller stage of its life cycle. Like this worm, many other organisms can make us sick if they manage to enter our body. Fortunately for us, our immune system is able to keep out most such invaders. The immune system protects the body from worms, germs, and other agents of harm. The immune system is like a medieval castle. The outside of the castle was protected by a moat and high stone walls. Inside the castle, soldiers were ready to fight off any invaders that managed to get through the outer defenses. Like a medieval castle, the immune system has a series of defenses. In fact, it has three lines of defense. Only pathogens that are able to get through all three lines of defense can harm the body. The body’s first line of defense consists of different types of barriers that keep most pathogens out of the body. Pathogens are disease-causing agents, such as bacteria and viruses. These and other types of pathogens are described in Figure 13.80. Regardless of the type of pathogen, however, the first line of defense is always the same. 
Mechanical  Barriers 	  Mechanical barriers physically block pathogens from entering the body. The skin is the most important mechanical barrier. In fact, it is the single most important defense the body has. The outer layer of the skin is tough and very difficult for pathogens to penetrate. Mucous membranes provide a mechanical barrier at body openings. They also line the respiratory, GI, urinary, and reproductive tracts. Mucous membranes secrete mucus, a slimy substance that traps pathogens. The membranes also have hair-like cilia. The cilia sweep mucus and pathogens toward body openings where they can be removed from the body. When you sneeze or cough, pathogens are removed from the nose and throat (see Figure 13.81). Tears wash pathogens from the eyes, and urine flushes pathogens out of the urinary tract. You can watch the sweeping action of cilia at the following link: URL . 
Chemical  Barriers 	  Chemical barriers destroy pathogens on the outer body surface, at body openings, and on inner body linings. Sweat, mucus, tears, and saliva all contain enzymes that kill pathogens. Urine is too acidic for many pathogens, and semen contains zinc, which most pathogens cannot tolerate. In addition, stomach acid kills pathogens that enter the GI tract in food or water. Types of pathogens that commonly cause human diseases include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Which type of pathogen causes the common cold? Which type causes athlete’s foot? 
A sneeze can expel many pathogens from 	  the respiratory tract. 
That’s why you 	  should always cover your mouth and nose and when you sneeze. 
Biological  Barriers 	  Biological barriers are living organisms that help protect the body. Millions of harmless bacteria live on the human skin. Many more live in the GI tract. The harmless bacteria use up food and space so harmful bacteria cannot grow. 
Summary 	  • Barriers that keep out pathogens are the body’s first line of defense. • The first line of defense includes mechanical, chemical, and biological barriers. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • First line of defence – non-specific barriers at URL -2e88-8b23de2a630c/1/human_bio_science_3b.zip/content/004_internal_defence/page_03.htm . • Explain the inflammatory response. • Describe cytokines and histamines. • Outline how nonspecific leukocytes help fight pathogens that enter the body. • Define phagocytosis. What happens when an enemy gets past the first line of defense? For this running back to make it past the first line of defense, there usually has to be a hole or break in the line. He then runs into the secondary, or the second line of defense. Whenever the skin is broken, it is possible for pathogens to easily enter your body. They get past the first line of defense, and run into the second line of defense. 
The  Second  Line of  Defense 	  If you have a cut on your hand, the break in the skin provides a way for pathogens to enter your body. Assume bacteria enter through the cut and infect the wound. These bacteria would then encounter the body’s second line of defense. 
Inflammatory  Response 	  The cut on your hand may become red, warm, and swollen. These are signs of an inflammatory response. This is the first reaction of the body to tissue damage or infection. As explained in Figure 13.82, the response is triggered by chemicals called cytokines and histamines, which are released when tissue is injured or infected. The chemicals communicate with other cells and coordinate the inflammatory response. You can see an animation of the inflammatory response at this link: URL . The inflammatory response is discussed at URL . This drawing shows what happens during the inflammatory response. Why are changes in capillaries important for this response? Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Leukocytes 	  The chemicals that trigger an inflammatory response attract leukocytes to the site of injury or infection. Leukocytes are white blood cells. Their role is to fight infections and get rid of debris. Leukocytes may respond with either a nonspecific or a specific defense. • A nonspecific defense is the same no matter what type of pathogen is involved. An example of a nonspecific defense is phagocytosis. This is the process in which leukocytes engulf and break down pathogens and debris. It is illustrated in Figure 13.83. The immune system’s first line of defense is also a nonspecific defense. • A specific defense is tailored to a particular pathogen. Leukocytes involved in this type of defense are part of the immune response and are described in other concepts. In this image, leukocytes (white) are attacking pathogens (star-shaped). A summary of the nonspecific defenses can be viewed at URL (16:20). Click image to the left or use the URL below.

What happens when your tonsils cause more problems than they solve? Almost all of us have had a sore throat at some time. Maybe you had your tonsils out when you were younger? Why? Your tonsils are two lumps of tissue that work as germ fighters for your body. But sometimes germs like to hang out there, where they cause infections. In other words, your tonsils can cause more problems than they solve. So, you have them taken out. 
Lymphatic  System 	  Like the immune systems of other vertebrates, the human immune system is adaptive. If pathogens manage to get through the body’s first two lines of defense, the third line of defense takes over. The third line of defense is referred to as the immune response. This defense is specific to a particular pathogen, and it allows the immune system to “remember” the pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen tries to invade the body again, the immune response against that pathogen will be much faster and stronger. You can watch an overview of the immune response at this link: URL QQ . Click image to the left or use the URL below. The types of immune responses are discussed at URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. The immune response mainly involves the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a major part of the immune system. It produces leukocytes called lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are the key cells involved in the immune response. They recognize and help destroy particular pathogens in body fluids and cells. They also destroy certain cancer cells. You can watch an animation of the lymphatic system at this link: URL Rk . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Structures of the  Lymphatic  System 	  nodes. Organs of the lymphatic system are the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and tonsils. • Bone marrow is found inside many bones. It produces lymphocytes. • The thymus is located in the upper chest behind the breast bone. It stores and matures lymphocytes. • The spleen is in the upper abdomen. It filters pathogens and worn out red blood cells from the blood, and then lymphocytes in the spleen destroy them. • The tonsils are located on either side of the pharynx in the throat. They trap pathogens, which are destroyed by lymphocytes in the tonsils. 
Lymphatic  Vessels and  Lymph 	  Lymphatic vessels make up a body-wide circulatory system. The fluid they circulate is lymph. Lymph is a fluid that leaks out of capillaries into spaces between cells. As the lymph accumulates between cells, it diffuses into tiny lymphatic vessels. The lymph then moves through the lymphatic system from smaller to larger vessels. It finally drains back into the bloodstream in the chest. As lymph passes through the lymphatic vessels, pathogens are filtered out at small structures called lymph nodes (see Figure 13.84). The filtered pathogens are destroyed by lymphocytes. The lymphatic system consists of organs, vessels, and lymph. 
Lymphocytes 	  The human body has as many as two trillion lymphocytes, and lymphocytes make up about 25% of all leukocytes. The majority of lymphocytes are found in the lymphatic system, where they are most likely to encounter pathogens. The rest are found in the blood. There are two major types of lymphocytes, called B cells and T cells. These cells get their names from the organs in which they mature. B cells mature in bone marrow, and T cells mature in the thymus. Both B and T cells recognize and respond to particular pathogens. 
Antigen  Recognition 	  B cells and T cells actually recognize and respond to antigens on pathogens. Antigens are molecules that the immune system recognizes as foreign to the body. Antigens are also found on cancer cells and the cells of transplanted organs. They trigger the immune system to react against the cells that carry them. This is why a transplanted organ may be rejected by the recipient’s immune system. How do B and T cells recognize specific antigens? They have receptor molecules on their surface that bind only with particular antigens. As shown in Figure 13.85, the fit between an antigen and a matching receptor molecule is like a key in a lock. 
An antigen fits the matching receptor 	  molecule like a key in a lock. 
Summary 	  • The body’s third line of defense is the immune response. This involves the lymphatic system. This system filters pathogens from lymph and produces lymphocytes. • Lymphocytes are the key cells in the immune response. They are leukocytes that become activated by a particular antigen. There are two major type of lymphocytes: B cells and T cells. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Lymphatic System at URL . • Describe the humoral immune response. • List the steps that occur in a humoral immune response. • Distinguish helper T cell from plasma cells and from memory cells. • Describe antibodies and an antigen-antibody complex. What are those Y-shaped things floating around the cell? They are antibodies, which are large proteins. And they signal specific antigens for destruction. It does help that the antigens are usually attached to pathogens. 
Humoral  Immune  Response 	  There are actually two types of immune responses: humoral and cell-mediated. The humoral immune response involves mainly B cells and takes place in blood and lymph. You can watch an animation of the humoral immune response at this link: URL . 
B  Cell  Activation 	  B cells must be activated by an antigen before they can fight pathogens. This happens in the sequence of events shown in Figure 13.86. First, a B cell encounters its matching antigen and engulfs it. The B cell then displays fragments of the antigen on its surface. This attracts a helper T cell. The helper T cell binds to the B cell at the antigen site and releases cytokines that “tell” or signal the B cell to develop into a plasma cell. B lymphocytes are further discussed at URL (14:13). Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Activation of a  B cell must occur before it 	  can respond to pathogens. What role do T cells play in the activation process? 
Plasma  Cells and  Antibody  Production 	  Plasma cells are activated B cells that secrete antibodies. Antibodies are large, Y-shaped proteins that recognize and bind to antigens. Plasma cells are like antibody factories, producing many copies of a single type of antibody. The antibodies travel throughout the body in blood and lymph. Each antibody binds to just one kind of antigen. When it does, it forms an antigen-antibody complex (see Figure 13.87). The complex flags the antigen-bearing cell for destruction by phagocytosis. The video at the link below shows how this happens. URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
An antibody matches only one type of 	  antigen. 
Memory  Cells 	  Most plasma cells live for just a few days, but some of them live much longer. They may even survive for the lifetime of the individual. Long-living plasma cells are called memory cells. They retain a “memory” of a specific pathogen long after an infection is over. They help launch a rapid response against the pathogen if it invades the body again in the future. 
Summary 	  • Activated B cells produce antibodies to a particular antigen. • Memory B cells remain in the body after the immune response is over and provide immunity to pathogens bearing the antigen. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Humoral and Cell-Mediated Immune Responses at URL iology/the-immune-system-and-other-body-defenses/humoral-and-cell-mediated-immune-responses . • Describe the cell-mediated immune response. • Identify the roles of T cells in a cell-mediated immune response. • Summarize how T cells are activated. • Distinguish between helper T cells, memory cells, cytotoxic T cells, and regulatory T cells. Do cells really attack other cells? They sure do. Depicted here is a group of T cells attacking a cancer cell. When they can, the T cells search out and destroy “bad” cells. 
Cell- Mediated  Immune  Response 	  In addition to the humoral response, the other type of immune response is the cell-mediated immune response, which involves mainly T cells. It leads to the destruction of cells that are infected with viruses. Some cancer cells are also destroyed in this way. There are several different types of T cells involved in a cell-mediated immune response, including helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory T cells. You can watch an animation of this type of immune response at this link: URL . 
T  Cell  Activation 	  All three types of T cells must be activated by an antigen before they can fight an infection or cancer. T cell activation is illustrated in Figure 13.88. It begins when a B cell or nonspecific leukocyte engulfs a virus and displays its antigens. When the T cell encounters the matching antigen on a leukocyte, it becomes activated. What happens next depends on which type of T cell it is. T cell activation requires another leukocyte to engulf a virus and display its antigen. 
Helper  T  Cells 	  Helper T cells are like the “managers” of the immune response. They secrete cytokines, which activate or control the activities of other lymphocytes. Most helper T cells die out once a pathogen has been cleared from the body, but a few remain as memory cells. These memory cells are ready to produce large numbers of antigen-specific helper T cells like themselves if they are exposed to the same antigen in the future. Helper T cells are discussed at URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Cytotoxic  T  Cells 	  Cytotoxic T cells destroy virus-infected cells and some cancer cells. Once activated, a cytotoxic T cell divides rapidly and produces an “army” of cells identical to itself. These cells travel throughout the body “searching” for more cells to destroy. Figure 13.89 shows how a cytotoxic T cell destroys a body cell infected with viruses. This T cell releases toxins that form pores in the membrane of the infected cell. This causes the cell to burst, destroying both the cell and the viruses inside it. You can watch an animation of the actions of cytotoxic T cells at this link: URL YBKl7U . Click image to the left or use the URL below. A cytotoxic T cell releases toxins that destroy an infected body cell and the viruses it contains. After an infection has been brought under control, most cytotoxic T cells die off. However, a few remain as memory cells. If the same pathogen enters the body again, the memory cells mount a rapid immune response. They quickly produce many copies of cytotoxic T cells specific to the antigen of that pathogen. 
Regulatory  T  Cells 	  Regulatory T cells are responsible for ending the cell-mediated immune response after an infection has been curbed. They also suppress T cells that mistakenly react against self antigens. What might happen if these T cells were not suppressed? 
Summary 	  • Activated T cells destroy certain cancer cells and cells infected by viruses. • Memory T cells remain in the body after the immune response and provide antigen-specific immunity to the virus. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Humoral and Cell-Mediated Immune Responses at URL iology/the-immune-system-and-other-body-defenses/humoral-and-cell-mediated-immune-responses . • Define immunity. • Distinguish between active and passive immunity. Is giving shots to young children a good thing? Many, if not most, children hated going to the doctor, as it often meant getting a shot. Why? The shot actually contained a weakened or dead pathogen. And putting some of that dead pathogen into you was a good thing. 
Immunity 	  Memory B and T cells help protect the body from re-infection by pathogens that infected the body in the past. Being able to resist a pathogen in this way is called immunity. Immunity can be active or passive. 
Active  Immunity 	  Active immunity results when an immune response to a pathogen produces memory cells. As long as the memory cells survive, the pathogen will be unable to cause a serious infection in the body. Some memory cells last for a lifetime and confer permanent immunity. Active immunity can also result from immunization. Immunization is the deliberate exposure of a person to a pathogen in order to provoke an immune response and the formation of memory cells specific to that pathogen. The pathogen is often injected. However, only part of a pathogen, a weakened form of the pathogen, or a dead pathogen is typically used. This causes an immune response without making the immunized person sick. This is how you most likely became immune to measles, mumps, and chicken pox. You can watch an animation showing how immunization brings about immunity at this link: URL . 
Passive  Immunity 	  Passive immunity results when antibodies are transferred to a person who has never been exposed to the pathogen. Passive immunity lasts only as long as the antibodies survive in body fluids. This is usually between a few days and a few months. Passive immunity may be acquired by a fetus through its mother’s blood. It may also be acquired by an infant though the mother’s breast milk. Older children and adults can acquire passive immunity through the injection of antibodies. 
Summary 	  • Immunity is the ability to resist infection by a pathogen. • Active immunity results from an immune response to a pathogen and the formation of memory cells. • Passive immunity results from the transfer of antibodies to a person who has not been exposed to the pathogen. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Making Vaccines at URL . • Define allergy. • Identify common allergens. • Describe anaphylaxis. Have you ever started to sneeze and not known why? A beautiful sea of flowers. A nice sight, unless you have an allergic reaction. It is not uncommon to have reactions to pollen. 
Allergies 	  Your immune system usually protects you from pathogens and keeps you well. However, like any other body system, the immune system itself can develop problems. Sometimes it responds to harmless foreign substances as though they were pathogens. Sometimes it attacks the body’s own cells. Certain diseases can also attack and damage the immune system and interfere with its ability to defend the body. An allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen. Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen. Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure 13.90. Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes. Ragweed and poison ivy are common causes of allergies. Are you allergic to these plants? The symptoms of allergies can range from mild to severe. Mild allergy symptoms are often treated with antihistamines. These are drugs that reduce or eliminate the effects of the histamines that cause allergy symptoms. Recall that histamines trigger the inflammatory response. The most severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. This is a life-threatening response caused by a massive release of histamines. It requires emergency medical treatment.

Not an uncommon problem as you grow older. Is it due to normal wear and tear on the joints? Possibly. But rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, which means the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. 
Autoimmune  Diseases 	  Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system fails to recognize the body’s own molecules as “self,” or belonging to the person. Instead, it attacks body cells as though they were dangerous pathogens. There are more than disorders occur, these regulatory T cells fail in their function. This results in damage to various organs and tissues. The type of autoimmune disorder depends on the type of body tissue that is affected. Some relatively common autoimmune diseases are listed in Table 13.9. These diseases cannot be cured, although they can be treated to relieve symptoms and prevent some of the long-term damage they cause.

Summary 	  • Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system fails to distinguish self from non-self. As a result, the immune system attacks the body’s own cells.

Usually you are. Normally your body can put up a strong defense against enemy pathogens. But what if it can’t? What happens if your immune system is "sick"? 
Immunodeficiency 	  Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is not working properly. As a result, it cannot fight off pathogens that a normal immune system would be able to resist. Most commonly, immunodeficiency diseases occur when T or B cells (or both) do not work as well as they should, or when your body doesn’t produce enough antibodies. Rarely, the problem is caused by a defective gene. Inherited immunodeficiency disorders that affect B cells include hypogammaglobulinemia, which usually leads to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, and agammaglobulinemia, which results in severe infections early in life, and is often deadly. More often, immunodeficiency is acquired during a person’s lifetime. Immunodeficiency may occur for a variety of reasons: • The immune system naturally becomes less effective as people get older. This is why older people are generally more susceptible to disease. • The immune system may be damaged by other disorders, such as obesity or drug abuse. • Certain medications can suppress the immune system. This is an intended effect of drugs given to people with transplanted organs. In many cases, however, it is an unwanted side effect of drugs used to treat other diseases. • Some pathogens attack and destroy cells of the immune system. An example is the virus known as HIV. It is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in the world today. Compromised immune systems (What is Immunocompromised? ) are discussed at URL ?v=usRofaZEteY (2:36).

How long can a person live with HIV? Years ago, a diagnosis of an HIV infection was a death sentence. Not today. With the proper medical treatment, an individual can live well over 10 or 20 or more productive years with an AIDS diagnosis. One of the most famous individuals with HIV is Earvin “Magic” Johnson, a retired professional basketball player. He was diagnosed in 1991. Over 20 years later, he is still doing well. 
V and  	  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the immune system. An example of HIV is shown in This may not occur until many years after the virus first enters the body. 
V  Transmission 	  HIV is transmitted, or spread, through direct contact of mucous membranes or body fluids such as blood, semen, or breast milk. As shown in Figure 13.92, transmission of the virus can occur through sexual contact or the use of contaminated hypodermic needles. It can also be transmitted through an infected mother’s blood to her baby during late pregnancy or birth or through breast milk after birth. In the past, HIV was also transmitted through blood transfusions. Because donated blood is now screened for HIV, the virus is no longer transmitted this way. HIV is not spread through saliva, touching or in swimming pools. 
V is a virus that attacks cells of the 	  immune system. 
V and the  Immune  System 	  HIV infects and destroys helper T cells. As shown in Figure 13.93, the virus injects its own DNA into a helper T cell and uses the T cell’s “machinery” to make copies of itself. In the process the T cell is destroyed, and the virus copies go on to infect other helper T cells. You can watch an animation showing how HIV infects T cells at this link: URL Click image to the left or use the URL below. HIV is able to evade the immune system and keep destroying T cells. This occurs in two ways: • The virus frequently mutates and changes its surface antigens. This prevents antigen-specific lymphocytes from developing that could destroy cells infected with the virus. • The virus uses the plasma membranes of host cells to hide its own antigens. This prevents the host’s immune system from detecting the antigens and destroying infected cells. As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure 13.94 shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. HIV may be transmitted in all of the ways shown here. Based on how HIV is transmitted, what can people do to protect themselves from becoming infected? What choices can they make to prevent infection? 
 	  AIDS is not a single disease but a set of diseases. It results from years of damage to the immune system by HIV. It occurs when helper T cells fall to a very low level and opportunistic diseases occur (see Figure 13.94). Opportunistic diseases are infections and tumors that are rare except in people with immunodeficiency. The diseases take advantage of the opportunity presented by people whose immune systems can’t fight back. Opportunistic diseases are usually the direct cause of death of people with AIDS.

This diagram shows how  V infects and 	  destroys T cells. It typically takes several years after infection with HIV for the drop in T cells to cripple the immune system. What do you think explains the brief spike in T cells that occurs early in the HIV infection shown here? AIDS and HIV were first identified in 1981. Scientists think that the virus originally infected monkeys but then jumped to human populations, probably sometime during the early to mid-1900s. This most likely occurred in West Africa, but the virus soon spread around the world (see Figure 13.95). Since then, HIV has killed more than 25 million people worldwide. The hardest hit countries are in Africa, where medicines to slow down the virus are least available. The worldwide economic toll of HIV and AIDS has also been enormous. This map shows the number of people in different countries with HIV infections and AIDS in 2008. The rate of spread of the infection is higher Africa than in the U.S., yet the U.S. has a relatively large number of people with HIV infections and AIDS. Why might there be more survivors with HIV infections and AIDS in the U.S. than in Africa? 
V  Research:  Beyond the  Vaccine 	  Over the past 15 years, the number of people who die of AIDS each year in the United States has dropped by women. And in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus killed more than 1.6 million people in 2007 alone. Innovative research approaches could lead to new treatments and possibly a cure for AIDS. HIV/AIDS has been described as a disease of poverty. Individuals with poor access to health care are less likely to see a doctor early on in their HIV infection, and thus they may be more likely to transmit the infection. HIV is now the leading cause of death for African American women between 24 and 35 years old. For patients who have access to drugs, infection with the virus has ceased to be a death sentence. In 1995, combinations of drugs called highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) were developed. For some patients, drugs can reduce the amount of virus to undetectable levels. But some amount of virus always hides in the body’s immune cells and attacks again if the patient stops taking his or her medication. Researchers are working on developing a drug to wipe out this hidden virus, which could mean the end of AIDS. See URL quest/television/hiv-research-beyond-the-vaccine for further information.

Would you believe the male reproductive structures are over 100 feet long? The male reproductive system has two goals: to produce and deliver sperm and to secrete testosterone. Might seem simple. But there are a number of complicated processes and structures including over 100 feet of tubules that go into these simple goals. The male reproductive system has two main functions: (1) to produce sperm, the male gamete, and (2) to release the male sex hormone, testosterone, into the body. 
Male  Reproductive  Structures 	  The reproductive system in both males and females consists of structures that produce reproductive cells, or gametes, and secrete sex hormones. A gamete is a haploid cell that combines with another haploid gamete during fertilization. Recall that haploid cells have one complete set of chromosomes; in humans that would be 22 autosomes and one sex chromosome. Sex hormones are chemical messengers that control sexual development and reproduction. The male reproductive system consists of structures that produce male gametes called sperm and secrete the male sex hormone testosterone. The main structures of the male reproductive system are shown in Figure 13.96. Locate them in the figure as you read about them below. You can also watch an animation about male reproductive structures at this link: URL ww.medindia.net/animation/male_reproductive_system.asp . 
Male  Reproductive  Structures.  Organs of 	  the male reproductive system include the testes, and epididymis. Several penis, ducts and glands are also part of the system. Do you know the reproductive functions of any of these structures? 
Penis 	  The penis is an external genital organ with a long shaft and enlarged tip called the glans penis. The shaft of the penis contains erectile tissues that can fill with blood and cause an erection. When this occurs, the penis gets bigger and stiffer. The urethra passes through the penis. Sperm pass out of the body through the urethra. (During urination, the urethra carries urine from the bladder.) 
Testes 	  The two testes (singular, testis) are located below the penis. They hang between the thighs in a sac of skin called the scrotum. Each testis contains more than 30 meters (over 90 feet) of tiny, tightly packed tubules called seminiferous tubules. These tubules are the functional units of the testes. They produce sperm and secrete testosterone. 
Epididymis 	  The seminiferous tubules within each testis join to form the epididymis. The epididymis (plural, epididymis) is a coiled tube about 6 meters (20 feet) long lying atop the testis inside the scrotum. The functions of the epididymis are to mature and store sperm until they leave the body. 
Ducts and  Glands 	  In addition to these organs, the male reproductive system consists of a series of ducts and glands. Ducts include the vas deferens and ejaculatory ducts. They transport sperm from the epididymis to the urethra in the penis. Glands include the seminal vesicles and prostate gland. They secrete substances that become part of semen. 
Semen 	  Semen is the fluid that carries sperm through the urethra and out of the body. In addition to sperm, it contains secretions from the glands. The secretions control pH and provide sperm with nutrients for energy. 
Summary 	  • The male reproductive system consists of structures that produce sperm and secrete testosterone. • Male reproductive structures include the penis, testes, and epididymis. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Male reproductive System at URL . • Explain how the male reproductive system develops. • Summarize the roles of testosterone and luteinizing hormone. • Define the adolescent growth spurt. What’s changes happen during puberty? A lot changes during this time. A boy has to start shaving, his voice deepens, he gets taller, as well as a few other changes. 
Sexual  Development in  Males 	  The only obvious difference between boys and girls at birth is their reproductive organs. However, even the reproductive organs start out the same in both sexes. 
Development  Before  Birth 	  In the first several weeks after fertilization, males and females are essentially the same except for their chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have an X and a Y chromosome (XY). Then, during the second month after fertilization, genes on the Y chromosome of males cause the secretion of testosterone. Testosterone stimulates the reproductive organs to develop into male organs. (Without testosterone, the reproductive organs always develop into female organs.) Although boys have male reproductive organs at birth, the organs are immature and not yet able to produce sperm or secrete testosterone. 
Puberty and  Its  Changes 	  The reproductive organs grow very slowly during childhood and do not mature until puberty. Puberty is the period during which humans become sexually mature. In the U.S., boys generally begin puberty at about age 12 and complete it at about age 18. What causes puberty to begin? The hypothalamus in the brain “tells” the pituitary gland to secrete hormones that target the testes. The main pituitary hormone involved is luteinizing hormone (LH). It stimulates the testes to secrete testosterone. Testosterone, in turn, promotes protein synthesis and growth. 
It brings about most of the 	  physical changes of puberty, some of which are shown in Figure 13.97. In addition to the changes shown below, during puberty male facial hair begins to grow, the shoulders broaden, and the male voice deepens. You can watch an animation of these and other changes that occur in boys during puberty at the Interactive Body link: URL bc.co.uk/science/humanbody/body/interactives/lifecycle/teenagers/ . 
Some of the changes that occur in boys 	  during puberty are shown in this figure. 
Pubic hair grows, and the penis and 	  testes both become larger. 
Adolescent  Growth  Spurt 	  Another obvious change that occurs during puberty is rapid growth. This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. 
Summary 	  • The male reproductive system forms before birth but does not become capable of reproduction until it matures during puberty. • Puberty lasts from about ages 12 to 18 years and is controlled by hormones. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Interactive Body at URL . • Describe how sperm are produced. • Explain the role of the seminiferous tubules. • Distinguish between spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, and spermatids. • Summarize the structures of a mature sperm cell. How many sperm does to take to fertilize an egg? may produce more than a quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000) sperm cells in his lifetime! But it only takes one to fertilize an egg. 
Production and  Delivery of  Sperm 	  A sexually mature male produces an astounding number of sperm—typically, hundreds of millions each day! Sperm production usually continues uninterrupted until death, although the number and quality of sperm decline during later adulthood. 
Spermatogenesis 	  The process of producing mature sperm is called spermatogenesis. Sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules of the testes and become mature in the epididymis. The entire process takes about 9 to 10 weeks. You can watch an animation of spermatogenesis at this link: URL ndex.html . If you look inside the seminiferous tubule shown in Figure 13.98, you can see cells in various stages of spermatogenesis. The tubule is lined with spermatogonia, which are diploid, sperm-producing cells. Surrounding the Seminiferous Tubule. Cross section of a testis and seminiferous tubules. spermatogonia are other cells. Some of these other cells secrete substances to nourish sperm, and some secrete testosterone, which is needed for sperm production. Spermatogonia lining the seminiferous tubule undergo mitosis to form primary spermatocytes, which are also diploid. The primary spermatocytes undergo the first meiotic division to form secondary spermatocytes, which are haploid. Spermatocytes make up the next layer of cells inside the seminiferous tubule. Finally, the secondary spermatocytes complete meiosis to form spermatids. Spermatids make up a third layer of cells in the tubule. 
Sperm  Maturation 	  After spermatids form, they move into the epididymis to mature into sperm, like the one shown in Figure 13.99. The spermatids grow a tail and lose excess cytoplasm from the head. When a sperm is mature, the tail can rotate like a propeller, so the sperm can propel itself forward. Mitochondria in the connecting piece produce the energy (ATP) needed for movement. The head of the mature sperm consists mainly of the nucleus, which carries copies of the father’s chromosomes. The part of the head called the acrosome produces enzymes that help the sperm head penetrate an egg. 
Ejaculation 	  Sperm are released from the body during ejaculation. Ejaculation occurs when muscle contractions propel sperm from the epididymis. The sperm are forced through the ducts and out of the body through the urethra. As sperm travel through the ducts, they mix with fluids from the glands to form semen. Hundreds of millions of sperm are Mature Sperm Cell. A mature sperm cell has several structures that help it reach and penetrate an egg. These structures include the tail, mitochondria, and acrosome. How does each structure contribute to the sperm’s function? released with each ejaculation.

Think producing millions of sperm each day is complicated? If producing millions of sperm each day, as in the male reproductive system, is complicated, that is nothing compared to what must occur in the female reproductive system. This system is controlled by an intricate dance of hormones, cycles, and events. 
Female  Reproductive  Structures 	  The female reproductive system consists of structures that produce female gametes called eggs and secrete the female sex hormone estrogen. The female reproductive system has several other functions as well: The main structures of the female reproductive system are shown in Figure 13.100. Most of the structures are inside the pelvic region of the body. Locate the structures in the figure as you read about them below. To watch an animation of the female reproductive system, go to this link: URL ctive_system.asp . 
Female  Reproductive  Structures.  Organs 	  of the female reproductive system include the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. 
External  Structures 	  The external female reproductive structures are referred to collectively as the vulva. They include the labia (singular, labium), which are the “lips” of the vulva. The labia protect the vagina and urethra, both of which have openings in the vulva. 
Vagina 	  The vagina is a tube-like structure about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) long. It begins at the vulva and extends upward to the uterus. It has muscular walls lined with mucous membranes. The vagina has two major reproductive functions. It receives sperm during sexual intercourse, and it provides a passageway for a baby to leave the mother’s body during birth. 
Uterus 	  The uterus is a muscular organ shaped like an upside-down pear. It has a thick lining of tissues called the endometrium. The lower, narrower end of the uterus is known as the cervix. The uterus is where a fetus grows and develops until birth. During pregnancy, the uterus can expand greatly to make room for the baby as it grows. During birth, contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus push the baby through the cervix and out of the body. 
Ovaries 	  The two ovaries are small, egg-shaped organs that lie on either side of the uterus. They produce eggs and secrete estrogen. Each egg is located inside a structure called a follicle. Cells in the follicle protect the egg and help it mature. 
Fallopian  Tubes 	  Extending from the upper corners of the uterus are the two fallopian tubes. Each tube reaches (but is not attached to) one of the ovaries. The ovary end of the tube has a fringelike structure that moves in waves. The motion sweeps eggs from the ovary into the tube. 
Breasts 	  The breasts are not directly involved in reproduction, but they nourish a baby after birth. Each breast contains mammary glands, which secrete milk. The milk drains into ducts leading to the nipple. A suckling baby squeezes the milk out of the ducts and through the nipple. 
Summary 	  • The female reproductive system consists of structures that produce eggs and secrete female sex hormones. They also provide a site for fertilization and enable the development and birth of a fetus. • Female reproductive structures include the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. Use the following resource to answer the questions that follow. • Female Reproductive System at URL . • Explain how the female reproductive system develops. • Outline the roles of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. • Define menarche and menstruation. What changes happen during puberty? A lot changes during this time. Girls may become interested in many new things, including the art of makeup. 
Sexual  Development in  Females 	  Female reproductive organs form before birth. However, as in males, the organs do not mature until puberty. 
Development  Before  Birth 	  Unlike males, females are not influenced by the male sex hormone testosterone during embryonic development. This is because they lack a Y chromosome. As a result, females do not develop male reproductive organs. By the third month of fetal development, most of the internal female organs have formed. Immature eggs also form in the ovary before birth. Whereas a mature male produces sperm throughout his life, a female produces all the eggs she will ever make before birth. 
Changes of  Puberty 	  Like baby boys, baby girls are born with all their reproductive organs present but immature and unable to function. Female reproductive organs also grow very little until puberty. Girls begin puberty a year or two earlier than boys, at an average age of 10 years. Girls also complete puberty sooner than boys, in about 4 years instead of 6. Puberty in girls starts when the hypothalamus “tells” the pituitary gland to secrete hormones that target the ovaries. Two pituitary hormones are involved: luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones stimulate the ovary to produce estrogen. Estrogen, in turn, promotes growth and other physical changes of puberty. It stimulates growth and development of the internal reproductive organs, breasts, and pubic hair (see link: URL . 
Changes in  Females  During  Puberty.  Two 	  obvious changes of puberty in girls are growth and development of the breasts and pubic hair. The stages begin around age 10 and are completed by about age 
Adolescent  Growth  Spurt 	  Like boys, girls also go through an adolescent growth spurt. However, girls typically start their growth spurt a year or two earlier than boys (and therefore a couple of centimeters shorter, on average). Girls also have a shorter growth spurt. For example, they typically reach their adult height by about age 15. In addition, girls generally do not grow as fast as boys do during the growth spurt, even at their peak rate of growth. As a result, females are about 
Menarche 	  One of the most significant changes in females during puberty is menarche. Menarche is the beginning of menstruation, or monthly periods as the ovaries begin the cyclic release of an egg. In U.S. girls, the average age of menarche is 12.5 years, although there is a lot of variation in this age. The variation may be due to a combination of genetic factors and environmental factors, such as diet.

What’s amazing about these cells? Many things. A human egg cell. Just add sperm and you have the necessary ingredients for a new baby. What’s amazing about these cells is that they are all produced before the girl is even born. Before the girl is even born, plans for the next generation have begun. And that is the start of an amazing process. 
Egg  Production 	  At birth, a female’s ovaries contain all the eggs she will ever produce. However, the eggs do not start to mature until she enters puberty. After menarche, one egg typically matures each month until a woman reaches middle adulthood. 
Oogenesis 	  The process of producing eggs in the ovary is called oogenesis. Eggs, like sperm, are haploid cells, and their production occurs in several steps that involve different types of cells, as shown in Figure 13.102. You can follow the process of oogenesis in the figure as you read about it below. Oogenesis begins long before birth when an oogonium with the diploid number of chromosomes undergoes mitosis. It produces a diploid daughter cell called a primary oocyte. The primary oocyte, in turn, starts to go through the 
Oogenesis.  Oogenesis begins before 	  birth but is not finished until after puberty. 
A mature egg forms only if a secondary 	  oocyte is fertilized by a sperm. first cell division of meiosis (meiosis I). However, it does not complete meiosis until much later. The primary oocyte remains in a resting state, nestled in a tiny, immature follicle until puberty. 
Maturation of a  Follicle 	  Beginning in puberty, each month one of the follicles and its primary oocyte starts to mature (also see Figure a polar body. Both the secondary oocyte and polar body are haploid cells. The secondary oocyte has most of the cytoplasm from the original cell and is much larger than the polar body. 
Ovulation and  Fertilization 	  After 12–14 days, when the follicle is mature, it bursts open, releasing the secondary oocyte from the ovary. This event is called ovulation (see Figure 13.103). The follicle, now called a corpus luteum, starts to degenerate, or break down. After the secondary oocyte leaves the ovary, it is swept into the nearby fallopian tube by the waving, fringelike end (see Figure 13.104). If the secondary oocyte is fertilized by a sperm as it is passing through the fallopian tube, it completes meiosis and forms a mature egg and another polar body. (The polar bodies break down and disappear.) If the secondary oocyte is not fertilized, it passes into the uterus as an immature egg and soon disintegrates. You can watch an animation of all these events and the hormones that control them at the link below. URL htm Maturation of a Follicle and Ovulation. 
A follicle matures and its primary oocyte 	  (follicle) resumes meiosis to form a secondary oocyte in the secondary follicle. 
The follicle ruptures and the oocyte leaves 	  the ovary during ovulation. What happens to the ruptured follicle then? Egg Entering Fallopian Tube. After ovulation, the fringelike end of the fallopian tube sweeps the oocyte inside of the tube, where it begins its journey to the uterus.

What’s the most important part of the female menstrual cycle? A menstrual cycle calendar. A lot of things to keep track of. And for a few very important reasons, it is important to know when a woman is ovulating. But what’s the most important part of the female menstrual cycle? That depends on who you ask. 
Menstrual  Cycle 	  Ovulation, the release of an egg from an ovary, is part of the menstrual cycle, which typically occurs each month in a sexually mature female unless she is pregnant. Another part of the cycle is the monthly period, or menstruation. Menstruation is the process in which the endometrium of the uterus is shed from the body. The menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones from the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and ovaries. For an interactive animation of the menstrual cycle, you can go this link: URL 
Phases of the  Menstrual  Cycle 	  As shown in Figure 13.105, the menstrual cycle occurs in several phases. The cycle begins with menstruation. During menstruation, arteries that supply the endometrium of the uterus constrict. As a result, the endometrium breaks down and detaches from the uterus. It passes out of the body through the vagina over a period of several days. Phases of the Menstrual Cycle. The menstrual cycle occurs in the phases shown here. After menstruation, the endometrium begins to build up again. At the same time, a follicle starts maturing in an ovary. Ovulation occurs around day 14 of the cycle. After it occurs, the endometrium continues to build up in preparation for a fertilized egg. What happens next depends on whether the egg is fertilized. If the egg is fertilized, the endometrium will be maintained and help nourish the egg. The ruptured follicle, now called the corpus luteum, will secrete the hormone progesterone. This hormone keeps the endometrium from breaking down. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum will break down and disappear. Without progesterone, the endometrium will also break down and be shed. A new menstrual cycle thus begins. 
Menopause 	  For most women, menstrual cycles continue until their midor lateforties. Then women go through menopause, a period during which their menstrual cycles slow down and eventually stop, generally by their early fifties. After menopause, women can no longer reproduce naturally because their ovaries no longer produce eggs. 
Summary 	  • The menstrual cycle includes events that take place in the ovary, such as ovulation. • The menstrual cycle also includes changes in the uterus, including menstruation. • Menopause occurs when menstruation stops occurring, usually in middle adulthood. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • The menstrual cycle at URL . the egg is not fertilized. including the days when they occur. • Describe the process of fertilization. • Outline the events that occur between fertilization and the embryonic stage. • Distinguish a morula from a blastocyst. • Define implantation. How far does a sperm have to swim? Sperm swimming to an egg. If fertilization occurs, the egg will have all the "instructions" to grow into a new organism. That one cell will become two, then four, then eight, then sixteen, and on and on and on. And after about cell is about two thousandths of an inch long. And although they are small, they can swim roughly 8 inches in an hour. To reach an egg, they will ultimately they have to swim around 192,000 times their own length. 
Cleavage and  Implantation 	  A day or two after an ovary releases an egg, the egg may unite with a sperm. Sperm are deposited in the vagina during sexual intercourse. They propel themselves through the uterus and enter a fallopian tube. This is where fertilization usually takes place. When a sperm penetrates the egg, it triggers the egg to complete meiosis. The sperm also undergoes changes. Its tail falls off, and its nucleus fuses with the nucleus of the egg. The resulting cell, called a zygote, contains all the chromosomes needed for a new human organism. Half the chromosomes come from the egg and half from the sperm. 
Morula and  Blastocyst  Stages 	  The zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, where it will take up residence. As it travels, it divides by mitosis several times to form a ball of cells called a morula. The cell divisions are called cleavage. They increase the number of cells but not the overall size of the new organism. As more cell divisions occur, a fluid-filled cavity forms inside the ball of cells. At this stage, the ball of cells is called a blastocyst. The cells of the blastocyst form an inner cell mass and an outer cell layer, as shown in Figure 13.106. The inner cell mass is called the embryoblast. These cells will soon develop into an embryo. The outer cell layer is called the trophoblast. These cells will develop into other structures needed to support and nourish the embryo. 
Blastocyst.  The blastocyst consists of an 	  outer layer of cells called the trophoblast and an inner cell mass called the embryoblast. The blastocyst fluid-filled cavity is also known as the blastocoel or blastocoele. 
Implantation 	  The blastocyst continues down the fallopian tube and reaches the uterus about 4 or 5 days after fertilization. When the outer cells of the blastocyst contact cells of the endometrium lining the uterus, the blastocyst embeds in the endometrium. The process of embedding is called implantation. It generally occurs about a week after fertilization. For a detailed look at fetal development, see URL . 
Summary 	  • Fertilization is the union of a sperm and egg, resulting in the formation of a zygote. • The zygote undergoes many cell divisions before it implants in the lining of the uterus. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Fertilization: Oocyte Activation Cell Cleavage at URL ivation-cell-cleavage.html . • Define embryo. • Compare the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. • Explain how the embryo forms specialized cells and organs. At one time, did we all really look alike? We all start as a single cell and soon grow into an embryo. Notice the remarkable details beginning to form. The eyes, backbone, and limb buds are obvious. Think about the amazing complexity that must be going on inside the embryo, and the tremendous amount of growth and development still to come. So, yes, at one time we all looked similar. 
Growth and  Development of the  Embryo 	  After implantation occurs, the blastocyst is called an embryo. The embryonic stage lasts through the eighth week following fertilization. During this time, the embryo grows in size and becomes more complex. It develops specialized cells and tissues and starts to form most organs. For an interactive animation of embryonic development, go to this link: URL . 
Formation of  Cell  Layers 	  During the second week after fertilization, cells in the embryo migrate to form three distinct cell layers, called the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Each layer will soon develop into different types of cells and tissues, as shown in Figure 13.107. 
Cell  Layers of the  Embryo.  The migration 	  of cells into three layers occurs in the 2week-old embryo. What organs eventually develop from the ectoderm cell layer? Which cell layer develops into muscle tissues? 
Differentiation of  Cells 	  A zygote is a single cell. How does a single cell develop into many different types of cells? During the third week after fertilization, the embryo begins to undergo cellular differentiation. Differentiation is the process by which unspecialized cells become specialized. As illustrated in Figure 13.108, differentiation occurs as certain genes are expressed ("switched on") while other genes are switched off. Because of this process, cells develop unique structures and abilities that suit them for their specialized functions. You can explore cell differentiation by watching the video at this link: URL . 
Organ  Formation 	  After cells differentiate, all the major organs begin to form during the remaining weeks of embryonic development. A few of the developments that occur in the embryo during weeks 4 through 8 are listed in Figure 13.109. As the embryo develops, it also grows in size. By the eighth week of development, the embryo is about 30 millimeters (just over 1 inch) in length. It may also have begun to move. 
Summary 	  • The embryonic stage begins with implantation. • An embryo forms three distinct cell layers, and each layer develops into different types of cells and organs. Cellular differentiation occurs in the 3week-old embryo. 
Embryonic  Development 	  (Weeks 4–8).

Notice the details in the face and hands. Compare this to the human embryo, and the amount of growth and development is truly remarkable. 
Growth and  Development of the  Fetus 	  From the end of the eighth week until birth, the developing human organism is referred to as a fetus. Birth typically occurs at about 38 weeks after fertilization, so the fetal period generally lasts about 30 weeks. During this time, as outlined in Figure 13.110, the organs complete their development. The fetus also grows rapidly in length and weight.

Click image to the left or use the URL below. Fetal Development (Weeks 9–38). Organ development is completed and body size increases dramatically during weeks By the 38th week, the fetus is fully developed and ready to be born (see Figure 13.111). A 38-week fetus normally ranges from 36 to 51 centimeters (14–20 inches) in length and weighs between 2.7 and 4.6 kilograms (about 6–10 pounds). 
Summary 	  • The fetal stage begins about two months after fertilization and continues until birth. • During this stage, organs continue to develop, and the fetus grows in size.

A 38-week-old fetus has completed development and will soon be born. • Fetal Development at URL , • Embryo to Fetus: Weeks 9 to 12 of Pregnancy at URL etus-weeks-9-to-12-of-pregnancy.htm? . • Define placenta. • Explain the role of the placenta and umbilical cord during fetal development. How does a developing baby breathe? Or eat? From mom of course. Shown is a detailed representation of the placenta. And this is where all these interactions occur. 
Placenta and  Related  Structures 	  The fetus could not grow and develop without oxygen and nutrients from the mother. Wastes from the fetus must also be removed in order for it to survive. The exchange of these substances between the mother and fetus occurs through the placenta. 
Placenta 	  The placenta is a temporary organ that begins to form from the trophoblast layer of cells shortly after implantation. The placenta continues to develop and grow to meet the needs of the growing fetus. A fully developed placenta is made up of a large mass of blood vessels from both the mother and fetus. The maternal and fetal vessels are close together but separated by tiny spaces. This allows the mother’s and fetus’s blood to exchange substances across their capillary walls without the blood actually mixing. See The Placenta and the Fetus: Structure and 
Function at http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/the-placenta-and-the-fetus-structure-and-function.html for 	  additional information. The fetus is connected to the placenta through the umbilical cord, a tube that contains two arteries and a vein. Blood from the fetus enters the placenta through the umbilical arteries, exchanges gases and other substances with the mother’s blood, and travels back to the fetus through the umbilical vein. 
The fetus and the placenta.  Notice the 	  fetus is attached to the placenta by the umbilical cord, made of two arteries and one vein. 
Amniotic  Sac and  Fluid 	  Attached to the placenta is the amniotic sac, an enclosed membrane that surrounds and protects the fetus. It contains amniotic fluid, which consists of water and dissolved substances. The fluid allows the fetus to move freely until it grows to fill most of the available space. The fluid also cushions the fetus and helps protect it from injury. 
Summary 	  • The placenta allows nutrients and wastes to be exchanged between the mother and fetus. • The fetus is connected to the placenta through the umbilical cord. Use these resources to answer the questions that follow. • Functions and Roles Of The Placenta at URL . • Describe pregnancy, labor and childbirth. Why is it called labor? So. . . the mother carries the developing baby for nine months. We know about the tremendous growth and development of the embryo and fetus. Then comes labor. 
Pregnancy and  Childbirth 	  Pregnancy is the carrying of one or more offspring from fertilization until birth. It is the development of an embryo and fetus from the expectant mother’s point of view. 
The  Mother’s  Role 	  The pregnant mother plays a critical role in the development of the embryo and fetus. She must avoid toxic substances such as alcohol, which can damage the developing offspring. She must also provide all the nutrients and other substances needed for normal growth and development. Most nutrients are needed in greater amounts by a pregnant woman, but some are especially important, including folic acid (vitamin B9), calcium, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids. 
Childbirth 	  Near the time of birth, the amniotic sac breaks in a gush of fluid. Often when this occurs, women say that their "water broke." Labor usually begins within a day of this event. Labor involves contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus, which cause the cervix to dilate. With the mother’s help, the contractions eventually push the fetus out of the uterus and through the vagina. Within seconds of birth, the umbilical cord is cut. Without this connection to the placenta, the baby cannot exchange gases, so carbon dioxide quickly builds up in the baby’s blood. This stimulates the brain to trigger breathing, and the newborn takes its first breath. See Labor and Birth BabyCenter Video at URL for additional information. Immediately after birth. 
Summary 	  • A pregnant woman should avoid toxins and take in adequate nutrients for normal fetal growth and development. • During childbirth, contractions of the uterus push the child out of the body.

What’s the main difference between an adorable little baby and a teenager? This quiet little baby will soon grow into someone who talks and expresses feelings and attitudes. What’s the main difference between an adorable little baby and a teenager? Plenty. 
From  Birth to  Adulthood 	  For the first year after birth, a baby is called an infant. Childhood begins at age two and continues until adolescence. Adolescence is the last stage of life before adulthood. 
Infancy 	  Infancy is the first year of life after birth. Infants are born with a surprising range of abilities. For example, they have well-developed senses of touch, hearing, and smell. They can also communicate their needs by crying. During their first year, they develop many other abilities, including those described below. For a video of major milestones in the first year of life, go to this link: URL . By 6 weeks after birth, infants typically start smiling (see Figure 13.114) and making vocal sounds. By 6 months, infants are babbling. They have also learned to sit and are starting to crawl. The deciduous teeth (baby teeth) have started to come in. By 12 months, infants may be saying their first words. They usually can stand with help and may even have started to walk. Infancy is the period of most rapid growth after birth. Growth is even faster during infancy that it is during puberty. By the end of the first year, the average baby is twice as long as it was at birth and three times as heavy. A baby’s first smile is an early milestone in infant development. 
Childhood 	  A toddler is a child aged 1 to 3 years. Children of this age are learning to walk, or “toddle.” Growth is still relatively rapid during the toddler years but it has begun to slow down. During the next three years, children achieve many more milestones. • By age 4, most children can run, climb stairs, and scribble with a crayon. They know many words and use simple sentences. The majority are also toilet trained. • By age five, children are able to carry on conversations, recognize letters and words, and use a pencil to trace letters. They can usually tie their own shoelaces and may be learning to ride a bicycle, swing a bat, kick a ball and play other games ( Figure 13.115). • By age 6, most children begin losing their deciduous teeth, and their permanent teeth start coming in. They speak fluently and are learning to read and write. They spend more time with peers and develop friendships. Five year olds can usually play various games. Older children continue to grow slowly until they start the adolescent growth spurt during puberty. They also continue to develop mentally, emotionally, and socially. Think about all the ways you have changed since you were as young as the child in Figure 13.115. What milestones of development did you achieve during these childhood years? 
Puberty 	  Puberty is the stage of life when a child becomes sexually mature. Puberty begins when the pituitary gland tells the testes to secrete testosterone in boys, and in girls the pituitary gland signals the ovaries to secrete estrogen. Changes that occur during puberty are discussed in the Male Reproductive Development and Female Reproductive Development concepts. 
Adolescence 	  Adolescence is the period of transition between the beginning of puberty and adulthood. Adolescence is also a time of significant mental, emotional, and social changes. For example: • Adolescents generally develop the ability to think abstractly. • Adolescents may have mood swings because of surging hormones. • Adolescents usually try to be more independent from their parents. • Adolescents typically spend much of their time with peers. • Adolescents may start to develop intimate relationships. 
Summary 	  • Growth and development are most rapid during infancy and slower throughout the rest of childhood until adolescence. • Adolescence involves mental, emotional, and social changes in addition to the physical changes of puberty. Use this resource to answer the questions that follow. • Piaget’s Stages of Development at URL . ment you have achieved since then. • Describe the stages of adulthood. • Describe the relationship between aging and heart disease. • Explain why aging occurs. Does getting older have to be a bad thing? Being older doesn’t necessarily mean being unable to do things and not enjoy life. These seniors look as if they thoroughly enjoy life. And some would say that life begins after all the children have moved out of the house. 
Adulthood and  Aging 	  Adulthood does not have a definite starting point. A person may be physically mature by age 16 or 17 but not defined as an adult by law until older ages. In the U.S., you can’t join the armed forces or vote until age 18. You can’t buy or use alcohol or take on many legal and financial responsibilities until age 21. to 21 years. Over 7,500 images of the same person have been condensed in a little over 6 minutes. Click image to the left or use the URL below. 
Early  Adulthood 	  Early adulthood coincides with the 20s and early 30s. During early adulthood, people generally form intimate relationships, both in friendship and love. Many people become engaged or marry during this time. Often they are completing their education and becoming established in a career. Health problems in young adults tend to be minor. The most common causes of death are homicides, car crashes, and suicides. 
Middle  Adulthood 	  Middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood. 
Heart  Disease 	  Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans, and one of the main killers of people the world over. A common cause of heart disease is arteriosclerosis. This is the stiffening or hardening of the arteries that happens, in part, because of growing older. Atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, is another cause of cardiovascular disease. When fat accumulates along the walls of arteries, there is less space for blood to flow. This makes it harder for blood to get to all the parts of the body that need it, including the heart itself. The accumulation of fatty deposits, or plaque, can eventually lead to a heart attack or stroke. Other changes to the heart occur during middle adulthood. For example, to help the heart pump blood through stiffer blood vessels, some parts of the heart wall thicken. The size of the four chambers of the heart also change, as do the valves between the chambers. The resting heart rate does not change as you age, but the heart cannot beat as fast when you are physically active or stressed, as it did when you were younger. Both genetic and lifestyle choices lead to heart disease. Though you cannot change your genetic background, there are things you can do to slow or prevent the onset of heart disease, especially as you grow older. • try to be more physically active, • if you smoke, quit, • follow a heart healthy diet, • keep a healthy weight. 
Old  Age 	  Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. 
Causes of  Aging 	  Why do we decline in all these ways as we age? Generally, it’s because cells stop dividing and die. There are at least two reasons why cells stop dividing: For additional information of aging, see the National Institute of Aging site at URL .

What does “safe Sex” truly mean? “Safe Sex.” The thought of a sexually transmitted infection should be enough to make you think about and believe in this saying. 
Understanding  Sexually  Transmitted  Infections 	  A shocking statistic made headlines in 2008. A recent study had found that one in four teen girls in the U.S. had a sexually transmitted infection. A sexually transmitted infection (STI) (also known as a sexually transmitted disease, or STD) is an infection caused by a pathogen that spreads mainly through sexual contact. Worldwide, a million people a day become infected with STIs. The majority of them are under the age of 25. For a video about sexually transmitted infections, go to this link: URL . Click image to the left or use the URL below. To be considered an STI, an infection must have only a small chance of spreading naturally in ways other than sexual contact. Some infections that can spread through sexual contact, such as the common cold, spread more commonly by other means. These infections are not considered STIs. 
Pathogens that  Cause  Is 	  STIs may be caused by several different types of pathogens, including protozoa, insects, bacteria, and viruses. For example: • Protozoa cause an STI called trichomoniasis. The pathogen infects the vagina in females and the urethra in males, causing symptoms such as burning and itching. Trichomoniasis is common in young people. • Pubic lice, like the one in Figure 13.116, are insect parasites that are transmitted sexually. They suck the blood of their host and irritate the skin in the pubic area. 
Public lice like this one are only about as 	  big as the head of a pin. Most STIs are caused by bacteria or viruses. Bacterial STIs can be cured with antibiotics. Viral STIs cannot be cured. Once you are infected with a viral STI, you are likely to be infected for life. 
How  Is  Spread 	  Most of the pathogens that cause STIs enter the body through mucous membranes of the reproductive organs. All sexual behaviors that involve contact between mucous membranes put a person at risk for infection. This includes vaginal, anal, and oral sexual behaviors. Many STIs can also be transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen, and breast milk. Therefore, behaviors such as sharing injection or tattoo needles is another way these STIs can spread. Why are STIs common in young people? One reason is that young people often take risks. They may think, “It can’t happen to me.” They also may not know how STIs are spread, so they don’t know how to protect themselves. In addition, young people may have multiple sexual partners. 
Preventing  Is 	  The only completely effective way to prevent infection with STIs is to avoid sexual contact and other risky behaviors. Using condoms can lower the risk of becoming infected with STIs during some types of sexual activity. However, condoms are not foolproof. Pathogens may be present on areas of the body not covered by condoms. Condoms can also break or be used incorrectly. 
Summary 	  • STIs are diseases caused by pathogens that spread through sexual contact. • Abstinence from sexual activity and other risk behaviors is the only completely effective way to prevent the spread of STIs.

Bacterial  Is 	  Many STIs are caused by bacteria. Some of the most common bacterial STIs are chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Bacterial STIs can be cured with antibiotics. 
Chlamydia 	  Chlamydia is the most common STI in the United States. As shown in the graph in Figure 13.117, females are much more likely than males to develop chlamydia. Like most STIs, rates of chlamydia are highest in teens and young adults. Symptoms of chlamydia may include a burning sensation during urination and a discharge from the vagina or penis. Chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics, but often there are no symptoms, so people do not seek treatment. Untreated chlamydia can lead to more serious problems, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This is an

Gonorrhea 	  Gonorrhea is another common STI. Symptoms of gonorrhea may include painful urination and discharge from the vagina or penis. Gonorrhea usually can be cured with antibiotics, although the bacteria have developed resistance to many of the drugs. Gonorrhea infections may not cause symptoms, especially in females, so they often go untreated. Untreated gonorrhea can lead to PID in females. It can lead to inflammation of the reproductive organs in males as well. 
Syphilis 	  Syphilis is less common than chlamydia or gonorrhea but more serious if untreated. Early symptoms of syphilis infection include a small sore on or near the genitals. The sore is painless and heals on its own, so it may go unnoticed. If treated early, most cases of syphilis can be cured with antibiotics. Untreated syphilis can cause serious damage to the heart, brain, and other organs. It may eventually lead to death.

Viral  Is 	  STIs caused by viruses include genital herpes, hepatitis B, genital warts, and HIV/AIDS. Whereas bacterial STIs can usually be cured with antibiotics, viral STIs cannot be cured. 
Genital  Herpes 	  Genital herpes is an STI caused by a herpes virus. In the United States, as many as one in four people are infected with the virus. Symptoms of genital herpes include painful blisters on the genitals (see Figure 13.118). The blisters usually go away on their own, but the virus remains in the body, causing periodic outbreaks of blisters throughout life. Outbreaks may be triggered by stress, illness, or other factors. A person with genital herpes is most likely to transmit the virus during an outbreak. To learn more about genital herpes, watch the video at this link: URL Ow .

Blisters like these on the genitals are a 	  sign of genital herpes. 
Hepatitis  	  Hepatitis B is inflammation of the liver caused by infection with the hepatitis B virus. In many people, the immune system quickly eliminates the virus from the body. However, in a small percentage of people, the virus remains in the body and continues to cause illness. It may eventually damage the liver and increase the risk of liver cancer, which is usually fatal. 
Genital  Warts and  Cervical  Cancer 	  Infections with the human papillomavirus (HPV) are very common. HPV may cause genital warts, which are small, rough growths on the genitals. It may also cause cancer of the cervix in females. A simple test, called a Pap test, can detect cervical cancer. If the cancer is detected early, it usually can be cured with surgery. There is also a vaccine , GARDASIL, to prevent infection with HPV. The vaccine is recommended for females aged 11 to 26 years.
