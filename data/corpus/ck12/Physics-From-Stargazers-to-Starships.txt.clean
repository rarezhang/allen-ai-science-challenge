Stargazers and  Sunwatchers 	  Early stargazers  especially the priests of Egypt and Babylon, semi-desert countries where skies are rarely clouded  were fascinated by the star-studded canopy which seemed to arch overhead, and by the daily cycle of the Sun, which seemed supernatural, beyond understanding. The ancient author of Psalm 19 wrote: The heavens declare the glory of God, And the firmament showeth His handiwork; Day unto day uttereth speech, And night unto night revealeth knowledge; There is no speech, there are no words, Neither is their voice heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them He has set a tent for the Sun, Which is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, And his circuit unto the ends of it; And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 
East,  West,  South, and  North 	  Imagine you were one of the early Babylonian skywatchers! You live on a plain, and as far as you can see, the world around you is absolutely flat (only careful observations of the surface of the ocean suggest anything different  See the chapter The Round Earth and Columbus" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL Your view is limited by the horizon, an imaginary line all around you at a distance of a few miles, or whatever units Babylonians used. Observing day after day, you note that the Sun always rises from roughly the same direction, which you name east. It sets in the opposite direction, and that will be west. In between the Sun rises in a long arc, and is furthest from the horizon halfway between its rising and setting, in a direction you call south. Finally, the direction opposite south will be north. When the Sun is near the horizon, shortly after sunrise or before sunset, a vertical pole or post casts a long shadow. At the highest point in the Suns motion, when it is in the south, the shadow is at its shortest. The time when this happens is halfway between sunrise and sunset, and we call it noon or maybe noon by the Sun," because noon by the clock" may differ. After noon shadows again grow longer, as the Sun descends towards the horizon. Because the shadow always points away from the Sun: At sunrise, with the Sun in the east, it points to the west. At noon, with the Sun in the south, it points north. At sunset, with the Sun in the west, it points to the east. That is the principle of the sundial, discussed in the chapter Making a Sundial" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL The Sun shortest shadow is due north at noon, while the evening sun creates a longer shadow due east. Suppose you watch the Sun rise and set day after day. Using as markers features on the horizon  trees, houses, etc.  you soon realize that the points where Sun rises and sets are not always the same, but shift week after week. On the other hand, the direction of south, where the Sun is highest above the horizon does not change, and neither does that of north, of the shortest shadow of the day. Because those directions are fixed, it is best to choose as the true east and west those directions which are perpendicular to north-south. Only twice each year are sunrise and sunset exactly in those directions, but they help measure and understand what happens in the rest of the year. 
Seasons of the  Year 	  Even in Babylon the year has seasonswinters are cool, summers dry and very hot. As already noted, twice a year, halfway between summer and winter, the Sun rises exactly in the east (as defined above), and sets exactly in the west (well, nearly exactly, in both cases). We now know that on the days when this happen, day and night are very nearly equal in length, and that time of year is therefore called equinox. One equinox happens in the fall (autumnal equinox") and one in the spring (vernal equinox," ver" is Latin for spring). As fall advances towards winter, the location of sunrise moves south, as does the location of sunset. The steepness of the curve traced by the Sun does not change, nor does the rate (speed") with which the Sun appears to move along it, but the length of the curve changes, it becomes shorter. Around December 21 the  winter solstice" halfway between the equinox dates (typically, September 23 and March 21) sunrise and sunset are as far south as they can go (at any one location). As a result, the Sun has its shortest path for the year, the day is at its shortest and night is at its longest. Other days of that season are short, too, which is one reason for the colder weather in winter. After that the points of sunrise and sunset migrate northward again, and days get longer. This migration continues past equinox (when it is at its fastest), and the Sun crosses the horizon furthest northwards around June 21, the  summer solstice" (celebrated in some cultures as midsummer day"), longest day of the year with the shortest night. After, that days get shorter again as sunset and sunrise migrate south again. The long days of summer, of course, match the warmer summer weather. The reason for this behavior will be described in the chapters The Ecliptic" and Seasons of the Year" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL In summer, the Suns path is longest, and so are the days. In winter, the Suns path is shortest, and so are the days. The length of the day is not the only reason summers are hot and winters cold. Another is the elevation of the Sun above the horizon. When the Sun is near the horizon, not only are the shadows which it casts stretched to greater length, so is its illumination. Any beam of sunlight then spreads out along a greater distance on the ground, diluting the heat given to any area. The noontime Sun in winter is low in the sky, and its heating is less pronounced, while the summer Sun can be almost overhead, heating the ground much more effectively. This is further discussed in the chapter The Angle of the Suns Rays" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL Babylonian priests, who tracked these regular changes of sunrise and sunset, soon realized that they provided an accurate way of measuring the passage of the seasons. They counted the days between solstices and equinoxes, and from this the first calendar was born. That was a great help to farmers, telling them when to prepare for sowing, when to expect seasonal rain, and in Egypt, when to expect the annual flood of the river Nile, which replenished the land. As will be described in the chapter The Calendar" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL other cultures also had their stargazers and developed calendars of their own, probably in much the same way. 
The  Celestial  Sphere 	  The Sun rules by daytime sky, but at night, especially if the Moon does not shine, the show belongs to the stars. Bright and dim, randomly distributed across the sky, with odd formations that catch the eye, their number seems huge. To ancient observers it seemed as if Earth was at the center of a giant star-studded  celestial sphere," which reinforced the belief, held for thousands of years, that we are at the center of the universe. If you watch stars throughout the night, you will see that most of them also rise to the east of you and set west of you, like the Sun and Moon. Indeed, the entire celestial sphere seems to rotate slowly  one turn in 24 hours  and since half of it is always hidden below the horizon, this rotation constantly brings out new stars on the eastern horizon, while others to disappear beneath the western one. We of course know that it is not the universe that rotates around us from east to west, but our Earth is the one rotating, (from west to eastsee note at end). But it is still convenient to talk about the rotation of the celestial sphere." That could also make the sky rotate the way it is observed to do. Note: The text above  and sections that follow  gives the period of rotation of the Earth as 24 hours. That is not exactly true: 24 hours is the mean length of a solar day, the average time that passes from noon to the next noon. Noon is always defined by the position of the Sun  when it passes exactly to the south (to viewers in Europe and the US, at least), and is at its greatest distance from the equator. Using the Sun for reference, however, gives a shifting reference point in the sky. Between one noon and the next, the Sun too moves slightly in the sky, as part of its annual circuit around the celestial sphere, discussed in the next section, on the ecliptic (See the chapter The Ecliptic" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL We could instead use some star as reference point, since stars keep fixed positions on the celestial sphere (see further below): for instance, define as  sidereal day" (sidereal  related to stars) the time between one passage of Sirius (the brightest star) to the south, and the next passage. That would be the true rotation period of the Earth, shorter than 24 hour by nearly 4 minutes  more accurately, 235.9 seconds. ( If you wish to calculate the difference: 24 hours are equal to 86400 seconds, and the average year contains 365.2422 solar days (See the chapter The Calendar" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL where this point is also discussed). Actually, however, the Earth completes 366.2422 rotations in that time, so the real rotation period is just (365.2422/366.2422) of 86400 seconds. You should be able to figure out the rest.) Most stars keep fixed positions relative to each other, night after night. The eye naturally groups them into patterns or constellations (stella" is Latin for star), to which each culture has given its own names. The names we use come from the ancient Greeks and the Romans, e.g. Orion the hunter, accompanied by his two faithful dogs nearby. Other names evoke animals, whose Latin names are used  Scorpio the scorpion, Leo the lion, Cygnus the swan, Ursa Major the Big Bear (better known as the big dipper") and so forth. The Sun slowly moves through this pattern, circling around it once a year, always along the same path among the stars (the ecliptic"). The ancients distinguished 12 constellations along this path, and since most are named for animals, they are known as the zodiac, the circle of animals." The Sun spends about one month inside each sign of the zodiac." The Moon moves close to the Suns path, but only takes about a month, and a few conspicuous stars also move near it, the planets. We will come back later to all these: all other celestial objects are firmly placed and do not move, forming the firmament." Like the globe in the drawing, the sphere of the sky has two points around which it turns, points that mark its axis the celestial poles. Stars near those poles march in daily circles around them, and the closer they are, the smaller the circles (they do not rise and set). At any time, only half the sphere is visible: it is as if the flat ground on which we stand sliced the celestial sphere in half  the upper half is seen, the lower half is not. Because of that, only one pole is seen at any time, and for most of us, living north of the equator, that is the north pole. (If you mount a camera on a dark night in a way that the pole is in the middle of its field of view, open the shutter and take a time exposure, the image of each star will be smeared into part of a circle, and all the circles will be centered on the pole. Go to URL to see such a picture.) Just as the globe of the Earth has an equator around its middle, halfway between the poles, so the sphere of the sky is circled by the celestial equator, halfway between the celestial poles. As the sky rotates, stars on the equator trace a longer circle than any others. Of course, we know well (as the priests in Babylon didnt) that the stars are not attached inside a huge hollow sphere. Rather, it is the Earth which rotates around its axis, while the stars are so distant that they seem to stand still. The final effect, however, is the same in both cases. Therefore, whenever that is convenient, we can still use the celestial sphere to mark the positions of stars in the sky. By pure chance, a moderately bright star is seen near the northern celestial polePolaris, the pole star (or north star). Polaris is not exactly at the pole, but its daily circle is very small and for many purposes one can assume it is at the pole, a pivot around which the entire sky rotates. All this looks much clearer if one remembers that it is the Earth that rotates, not the sky. The axis around which the Earth spins points in a certain direction in the sky, and that is also the direction of the pole star (or more accurately, the northern celestial pole). As the Earth turns, even though the observer moves with it (for instance, from point B in the drawing to point A), that direction always makes the same angle with the horizon and is always to the north. Hence the pole star is always in the same spot  north of the observer, and the same height above the horizon. If on a clear night you find yourself lost in the wilderness or at sea, the pole star can tell you where north is, and from that you easily deduce east, west and south. Any other star is unreliable for determining direction  it will move across the sky, and may even set  but not this one. For instructions on finding the pole star at night, go to the chapter Finding the Pole Star" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL The closer you are to the equator, the closer is the pole star to the horizon, and at the equator (point C) it is on the horizon, and probably not easy to see. Further south, at points such as D, it is no longer visible, but now you can see the southern pole of the sky. Unfortunately, no bright star comparable to Polaris marks that position. The existence of a bright star near the north celestial pole is just a lucky accident, and as will be seen, it wasnt always so, and will not be a few thousand years from now. As the drawing above makes clear, during the night we view the pole star from different positions (such as A and B). This however makes no noticeable difference in its place in the sky, because it is so distant from us. If the Earth rotated not around its axis but along a parallel line through A or B, the sky would not appear any different. The equatorial mounting of a telescope. To track a star it is only necessary to rotate the telescope around its polar axis. To the eye the rotation of the sky is very, very slow (it is most noticeable when the Sun or Moon are rising or setting). A telescope however greatly magnifies the rotation rate, and any star observed with it quickly drifts to the edge of the field of view and then disappear, unless the direction of the telescope is constantly adjusted. That is usually done automatically, by turning the telescope around an axis parallel to the Earths rotation, for as explained above, a parallel shift does not change the apparent rotation of the stars. To make such an adjustment easy, an astronomical telescope (pictured above) is mounted very differently from a surveyors telescope (a theodolite," pictured below). A theodolite usually has two axesone allows it to scan all horizontal directions over 360 degrees, while the other adjusts its elevation and allows it to set its sights on reference marks higher than the viewer, such as mountaintops. On the other hand, a telescope for viewing stars (above) also has two perpendicular axes, but the main one (the  equatorial axis") is slanted to point at the pole star and is therefore parallel to the Earths axis. As the celestial sphere rotates, a clockwork (or in cheap telescopes, the hand of the observer on a suitable knob) turns the telescope at a matching rate, keeping the same stars in the field of view. An old surveyors telescope (theodolite). Not all stars keep fixed positions on the sphere of the heavens. Even early sky-watchers noted that a few moved about: the ancient Greeks called them  planets", which translates to wanderers. The names we use today came from the Romans, who named them after their chief gods  Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Mercury and Venus are always close to the Sun and can only be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise: Mercury is so close that most of the year it cannot be seen at all, because the bright sky drowns out its light. Venus is brighter than any other star (with appropriate conditions and looking right at it, you can see it even in the daytime) and Jupiter takes second place. You can demonstrate that the rotation is west to east by using an apple or some other fruit to represent the Earth. Hold it with the stem verticalthat would be the axis of the Earth, north pole on topand mark two points in the northern half  New York and slightly clockwise from it, (= westward) San Francisco. You can use a lamp as your Sun," or imagine having a lamp somewhere nearby. When it is noon in New York, the Sun is almost overhead above New York," but it is still only 9 in the morning in San Francisco." Three hours later, the Earth has rotated and now it is noon at San Francisco," with the Sun close to overhead. To get to this position, San Francisco must rotate to the position New York was infrom west to east. 
Finding the  Pole  Star 	  Two bright constellations occupy opposite sides of the pole star  the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia. As the celestial sphere rotates (or appears to rotate), these constellations also march in circles around the pole . Depending on the hour of the night and the day of the year, one or the other may be low near the horizon where it is barely seen, or even hidden below the horizon. But when that happens the other constellation is sure to be high in the sky, where (weather permitting) it is easily seen. The Big Dipper consists of 7 bright stars, forming a dipper, a small pot with a long handle. In England it is often called the plough (spelled plow in the US), and fugitive slaves before the Civil War knew it as the drinking gourd, a signpost in the sky pointing the way north to safety, to Canada where slavery was outlawed. Astronomers name it Ursa Major, Latin for the big she-bear, and some other languages also refer to it as the Big Bear. In Greek, bear is Arktos, and hence the far-north region where this constellation is usually overhead became known as the Arctic. When the territory of Alaska in 1926 decided to create a flag of its own, it asked citizens to submit proposed designs for the new flag. The winning design was that of Benny Benson, age 13, and is reproduced here ( more about him  see below). It shows the 7 stars of the Big Dipper and Polaris, the north star. When Alaska became a state, this became the state flag. The flag also shows how the north star can be found. Imagine a line connecting the two stars at the front of the dipper, continue it on the side where the dipper is open to a distance 5 times that between the two stars (the flag shortens this a bit!), and you will arrive at (or very close to) the pole star. Because of their role in locating Polaris, these two stars are often called the guides. And by the way  the last-but-one star in the handle of the dipper, named Mizar by Arab astronomers, is a double star, whose components are readily separated by binoculars  or, some say, by very sharp eyes during good viewing conditions. Cassiopeia was a queen in Greek mythology, and the constellation named for her is shaped like the letter W. Polaris is above the first V of this letter. If you draw a line dividing the angle of that V in half and continue along it, you will reach the vicinity of Polaris. The name of Cassiopeias husband, King Cepheus, goes with a nearby constellation, above the other V (the brighter one), but Cepheus is nowhere as striking as Cassiopeia. Her daughter Andromeda has another constellation, framed by a big undistinguished rectangle of four stars. An unremarkable constellation to the eye  but it contains a large galaxy, our nearest neighbor in space (not counting two dwarf galaxies in the southern sky), one which seems to resemble ours in size and shape. Ursa Minor, the Small Bear or Little Dipperrdquo is a constellation somewhat resembling the Big Dipper, and Polaris is the last star in its tail. The dipper itself faces the tail of the Big Dipper, so that the two tails (or handles) point in opposite directions. The two front stars of the little dipper (quite smaller and more square than the big one) are fairly bright, but other stars are rather dim and require good eyes and a dark sky. Benny Benson was of mixed Swedish-Alutiiq parentage and grew up in the Aleut islands. He was placed in the Jesse-Lee Memorial Home for Orphans in Unalaska, Aleut islands, and later moved to Seward, Alaska, where he was attending the 7th grade when he proposed his flag design. He is honored with a monument at the end of 3rd Ave. in Seward. Later Benny became an airplane mechanic and lived on Kodiak. Throughout his life he made miniature Alaska flags and some are displayed in various public places. For more visit URL . 
The  Ecliptic 	  The apparent path of the Sun across the sky: In summer, the Suns path is longest, and so are the days. In winter, the Suns path is shortest, and so are the days. Even though the planets move on the celestial sphere, they do not wander all over it but are confined to a narrow strip, dividing it in half. Stars along that strip are traditionally divided into the 12 constellations of the zodiac. The name, related to zoo," comes because most of these constellations are named for animals Leo the lion, Aries the ram, Scorpio the scorpion, Cancer the crab, Pisces the fish, Capricorn the goat and Taurus the bull. At any time, the Sun is also somewhere on the celestial sphere, and as the Earth turns, it rises and sets the same way as stars do. Like the planets, the Sun, too, moves around the zodiac, making one complete circuit each year. Every month it covers a different constellation of the zodiac, which is the real reason why those constellations are 12 in number. Of course, during that month, this particular constellation is not seen, because the sky near the Sun is too bright for its stars to be seen (except, very briefly, during a total eclipse of the Sun). One can however figure out where the sun is on the zodiac (as ancient astronomers have done) by noting which is the last constellation of the zodiac to rise ahead of the Sun, or the first to set after it. Obviously, the Sun is somewhere in between. In this manner each month-long period of the year was given its sign of the zodiac." Astrologers, who believe that stars mysteriously direct our lives, claim it makes a great difference under what sign" a person was born. Be aware, however, that the sign" assigned to each month in horoscopes is not the constellation where the Sun is in that month, but where it would have been in ancient times. The difference is discussed in the section on the precession of the equinoxes (See the chapter The Precession" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL The path of the Sun across the celestial sphere is very close to that of the planets and the moon. After clocks became available, it was a relatively straightforward job for astronomers to relate the path of the Sun in the daytime to the one of stars at night, and to draw it on their star charts. Because of its relation to eclipses, that path is known as the ecliptic. The orbit of the Earth around the Sun. This is a perspective view, the shape of the actual orbit is very close to a circle. Planets seen in the sky are always near the ecliptic, which means that their orbits are never too far from the plane of the ecliptic. In other words, the solar system is rather flat, with all its major parts moving in nearly the same plane. What about the connection between ecliptic" and eclipses? The moons orbit cuts the ecliptic at a shallow angle, around 5 degrees, which means that on the celestial sphere the Moon, too, follows a path through the zodiac. Half the time the Moon is north of the ecliptic, half the time south of it. If the shadow of the moon hits the Earth, the Sun is eclipsed in the shadow area; if on the other hand the shadow of the Earth covers the moon, the moon goes dark and we have an eclipse of the moon. Either of these can only happen when the Sun, Earth and Moon are on the same straight line. Since the Sun and Earth are in the plane of the ecliptic, the line is automatically in that plane too; if the moon is also on the same line, it must be in the plane of the ecliptic as well. It takes close to a month for the Moon to go around the Earth (month" comes from Moon") and during that time its orbit crosses the ecliptic twice, as it goes from one side to the other. At the time of crossing, the Sun may be anywhere along the ecliptic; usually it is not on the Earth-Moon line, and therefore an eclipse usually does not take place. Occasionally, however, it is on that line or close to it. If it then happens to occupy exactly the same spot on the celestial sphere, we get an eclipse of the Sun, because the moon is then between us and the Sun. On the other hand, if it occupies the spot exactly opposite from that of the Moon, the Earths shadow falls on the Moon and we have an eclipse of the Moon.

Making a  Sundial 	  Some people can tell what time it is by looking at the sun. But I have never been able to make out the numbers." (Attributed to an essay by a student in elementary school.) The simplest sundial is a vertical stick rising from a flat horizontal surface. As the Sun rises, passes the highest point in its path (at noon and to the south, in the northern hemisphere) and sets, the shadow rotates around the stick in a clockwise direction, and its position can be used to mark time. Indeed, it has been claimed that the  clockwise" direction in which the hands on a clock rotate was chosen for this reason. A sundial with a vertical pointer ( gnomon") will indicate noon correctly when its shadow points north or south. [North in northern middle latitudes, south in southern ones, while near the equator it can be either way, depending on season.] However, the direction of the shadow at some other time of the day may depend on the seasonits value in summer, when the Suns path is high, may differ from what it is in winter, with Sun low above the horizon. Such a sundial will however work equally well at all times if the pointer is slanted, to point towards the pole of the celestial sphere (go to URL for an explanation  but be warned, it is a bit complicated!). The angle between it and the base then equals the geographic latitude of the user. Ornamental sundials are often found in parks and gardens, with the pointer widened into a triangular fin, which must point northwards. A sundial of this type can be constructed from folded cardboard or stiff paper, this is shown at URL to see the basic design used around latitude 38 North of the equator, go to URL for a corresponding one in the southern hemisphere. Either can be printed and then photo-copied onto suitable sheets of stiff paper or cardboard [You may want to use the option" menu to reduce size to 90% before printingbut make sure to return the setting to 100% afterwards!]. It is meant to be used at a latitude of 38 degrees and should work adequately in most of the continental US. 
Instructions 	  Note: In stiff paper, straight folds are helped by first scoring the paper, by drawing a line along them with a black ballpoint, guided by a ruler and pressed down hard. The sundial is now ready, but you might use tape on the bottom of the base-sheet to hold the two pieces together firmly. For further stability, and to prevent the sundial from being blown away, you may attach its base with thumbtacks to a section of a wooden board or a piece of plywood. If you want to make a sundial of more durable materials, draw the pre-noon hour lines at the angles to the fin (given in degrees) given below. These lines are meant for a latitude of 38 degrees; if your latitude is markedly different, see note at the end. 
Accuracy 	  The sundial will obviously be one hour off during daylight saving time in the summer, when clocks are reset. In addition, clock time" (or standard time") will differ from sundial time, because it is usually kept uniform across time zones; each time zone differs from its neighbors by one full hour (more in China and Alaska). In each such zone, sundial time matches clock time at only one geographical longitude: elsewhere a correction must be added, proportional to the difference in longitude from the locations where sundial time is exact. (Up to the second half of the 19th century, local time and sundial time were generally the same, and each city kept its own local time, as is still the case in Saudi Arabia. In the US standard time was introduced by the railroads, to help set up uniform timetables across the nation.) Finally, a small periodic variation exists (equation of time) amounting at most to about 15 minutes and contributed by two factors. First, the Earths motion around the sun is an ellipse, not a circle, with slightly variable speed in accordance with Keplers 2nd law (see URL as well as the section preceding that page). Secondly, the ecliptic (URL 
Note on  Latitude 	  ? The angles listed above are intended for a latitude of 38 degrees. If your latitude is L, denotes square root of and K = cotL = sinL2 then the angle between the fin and the line corresponding to the hour N+6 (N going from 0 to 6) satisfies cos15N sinA = ? Here 15N (=15 times N) is an angle in degrees, ranging from 0 to 90, and of course, the afternoon angles are mirror reflections of the morning ones. If your calculator has a button (sin?1), if you enter (sinA) and press it, you will get the angle A. For an explanation of sines and cosines, look up the math refresher. And dont forget to adjust the angle of your fin to L, too! 
And by the way 	  The sundial described here, with a gnomon pointing to the celestial pole, is a relatively recent invention, probably of the last 1000 years. Yet sundials were used long before, often with unequal hours at different times of the day. The Bible  2nd book of Kings, chapter 20, verses 9-11 (also Isaiah, ch. 38, v. 8) tells of an accidental sundial, in which the number of steps covered by the Suns shadow on a staircase was used to measure the passage of time. The Sundial Bridge, with a unique design which may well make it the largest sundial anywhere, opened July 4, 2004, in Turtle Bay Park (URL For a more detailed article about this bridge, see Sundial Bridge at Turtle Bay on wikipedia: URL wiki/Sundial_Bridge_at_Turtle_Bay . Before the days of affordable wristwatches, people often carried a folding sundial in their pocket (poke" below), with a small magnetic compass embedded, to show the north direction. In  As You Like It by William Shakespeare (act 2, scene 7) one of the characters tells of meeting in the forest a fool (witty court entertainer) carrying such a dial: Good morrow, fool, quoth I. No, sir, quoth he, Call me not fool till heaven sent me fortune: And then he drew a dial from his poke, And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye Says very wisely, It is ten oclock: Thus we may see how the world wags: T is but an hour ago since it was nine; And after one hour more t will be eleven; (and continues) You may also be interested to know that a North American Sundial Society (NASS) exists, with its home page at URL . The British Sundial Society also has its sundial page at URL . A sundial was included as part of the Mars lander mission and is shown in Astronomy Picture of the Day for April 28, 1999. It has a thick vertical gnomon, so that its readings may need some extra corrections.

Seasons of the  Year 	  The first section (See the chapter Stargazers and Sunwatchers" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL described the observed motion of the Sun across the sky, in different seasons of the year. This section tries to explain what is seen. If the Earths axis were perpendicular to the ecliptic, as in the drawing below, the Suns position in the sky would be halfway between the celestial poles, and its daily path, seen from any point on Earth, would stay exactly the same, day after day. Each point on Earth would be carried around the axis AB once a day. On the equator (point C) the sun would always rise until it was overhead, then again descend to the horizon. At the poles (A and B) it would always graze the horizon and never get away from it. Except at the pole, every point would be in the shadow half the time, when on the right of the line AB, and would experience night; the other half it would be in the sunlight, experiencing day. Because the motion is symmetric with respect to the line AB, day and night anywhere on Earth are always equal. Actually, the axis of rotation makes an angle of about 23. 5 degrees with the direction perpendicular to the ecliptic. That makes life a lot more interesting. In particular, the angle between the Earths axis and the Earth-Sun line changes throughout the year. Twice a year, at the spring and fall equinox (around March 21 and September 22the exact date may vary a bit) the two directions are perpendicular. Twice a year, the angle is as big as it can get, at the summer and winter solstices, when it reaches 23.5 degrees. In the summer solstice (around June 21) the north pole is inclined towards the Sun, in the winter solstice (around December 21) it faces away from it. Let us look at the summer first, with the Sun on the left. The boundary AB between sunlight and shadow  between day and night  is always perpendicular to the EarthSun line, as it was in the example shown at the beginning. But because of the tilted axis, as each point on Earth is carried on its daily trip around the rotating Earth, the part of the trip spent in daylight (unshaded part of the drawing) and in the shadow (shaded) are usually not equal. North of the equator, day is longer than night, and when we get close enough to the north pole, there is no night at all. The Sun is then always above the horizon and it just makes a 360-degree circuit around it. That part of Earth enjoys summer. A mirror-image situation exists south of the equator. Nights are longer than days, and the further one gets from the equator, the larger is the imbalanceuntil one gets so close to the pole that the sun never rises. That is the famous polar night, with 24 hours of darkness each day. In that half of the Earth, it is winter time. Half a year later, the Earth is on the other side of the Sun, that is, the Suns position in the above drawing should be on the right, and the shaded part of the Earth should now be on the left (light and dark portions in the drawing switch places). The Earths axis however has not moved, it is still pointed to the same patch of sky, near the star Polaris. Now the south pole is bathed in constant sunshine and the north one is dark. Summer and winter have switched hemispheres. A big difference between summer and winter is thus the length of the days: note that on the equator that length does not change, and hence Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter do not exist there (depending on weather patterns, however, there may exist a wet season" and a dry season"). In addition (as the drawing makes clear), the Suns rays hit the summer hemisphere more vertically than the winter one. That, too, helps heat the ground, as explained further in the chapter The Angle of the Suns Rays" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL At equinox, the situation is as in the first drawing, and night and day are equal (that is where the word equinox" comes from). If June 21 is the day when we receive the most sunshine, why is it regarded as the beginning of summer and not its peak? And similarly, why is December 21, the day of least sunshine, the beginning of winter and not mid-winter day? Blame the oceans, which heat up and cool down only slowly. By June 21 they are still cool from the winter time, and that delays the peak heat by about a month and a half. Similarly, in December the water still holds warmth from the summer, and the coldest days are still (on the averagenot always! ) a month and a half ahead. And what about our distance from the Sun? It, too, varies, because the Earths orbit around the Sun isnt an exact circle. We are closest to the Sun  would you believe it?  in the cold wintertime, around January 3-5. This may have an interesting implication for the origin of ice ages, as will be explained later. It also ties to an interesting story of the unusually bright Moon of December 22, 1999, see URL . 
Chapter  Outline 	  The apparent path of the Sun across the sky. Note how much higher the sun is during summer (green circle) In the US and in other mid-latitude countries north of the equator (e.g. those of Europe), the suns daily trip (as it appears to us) is an arc across the southern sky. (Of course, its really the Earth that does the moving.) The suns greatest height above the horizon occurs at noon, and how high the sun then gets depends on the season of the yearit is highest in mid-summer, lowest in mid-winter. Boy scouts used to be taught (perhaps still are) that someone lost in the woods can often tell the north direction by checking on which side of tree-trunks lichens grew best. Lichens avoid direct sunlight, and with the suns path curving across the southern sky, the north side of a tree-trunk is the one most shaded. For a similar reasonbut to collect sunlight rather than avoid itsolar collectors for heating water or generating electricity always face south. In addition, they are invariably tilted at an angle around 45?, to make sure that the arrival of the suns rays is as close to perpendicular as possible. The collector is then exposed to the highest concentration of sunlight: as the drawing shows, if the sun is 45 degrees above the horizon, a collector 0.7 meters wide perpendicular to its rays intercepts as much sunlight as a 1-meter collector flat on the ground. It therefore heats its water faster and reaches a higher temperature. French wine producers, too, have for centuries preferred southward-facing hillsides, on which ripening grapes get the most sunlight. The same also holds for the Earth. The rays of the summer sun, high in the sky, arrive at a steep angle and heat the land much more than those of the winter sun, which hit at a shallow angle. Although the length of the day is an important factor in explaining why summers are hot and winter cold, the angle of sunlight is probably more important. In the arctic summer, even though the sun shines 24 hours a day, it produces only moderate warmth, because it skims around the horizon and its light arrives at a low angle. The apparent motion of the sun can be important in designing a building, in particular in the placing of windows, which trap the suns heat. In a hot sunny climate such as that of Texas or Arizona, it is best to have the largest windows face north, avoiding the sun. The south-facing walls, on the other hand, should be well insulated and their windows should be small, allowing cross-ventilation when needed but not admitting much sunlight (wooden shutters on the outside of the windows also help). In Canada the opposite directions might be chosen, to trap as much heat as possible from the winter sun. Overhangs above south-facing windows also help. In summer, with the noontime Sun high in the sky, such an overhang casts a shadow on the window and keeps the house cool. In the winter, however, when the Sun stays close to the horizon, the overhang allows it to shine through the window and warm the rooms inside.

The  South  Wind is the baker 	  He kneads clouds in his den, And bakes a crisp new moon that ... greedy.... North.... Wind ....eats....again! What the Little Girl Said" Vachel (Nicholas) Lindsay, 1879-1931. The monthly cycle of the moon (we wont capitalize the word here) must have mystified early humans waxing" from thin crescent (new moon") to half-moon, then to a gibbous" moon and a full one, and afterwards waning" to a crescent again. That cycle, lasting about 29.5 days, gave us the word month"  related to moon," as is Monday." The civil year, January to December, no longer ties its months to the moon, but some traditions still do and their terms for month" reflect the connection  in Arabic, shahr, in biblical Hebrew yerach" and also chodesh" from new," since it was reckoned from one new moon to the next. Jericho (pronounced Yericho), one of the oldest cities on Earth, took its name from yerach," and of course, legends tell of many moon-gods and goddesses, e.g. Artemis and Diana. Early astronomers understood the different shapes of the moon, noting that each was linked to a certain relative position between moon and Sun: for instance, full moon always occurred when moon and Sun were at opposite ends of the sky. All this suggested that the moon was a sphere, illuminated by the Sun. The moons path across the sky was found to be close to the ecliptic, inclined to it by about 5 degrees. Eclipses of the Sun always occurred when moon and Sun were due to occupy the same spot in the sky, suggesting that the moon was nearer to us and obscured the Sun. Eclipses of the moon, similarly, always occurred at full moon, with the two on opposite sides of the Earth, and could be explained by the shadow of the Earth falling on the moon. Lunar eclipses allowed the Greek astronomer Aristarchus, around 220 BC, to estimate the distance to the moon (See the chapter Estimating the Distance to the Moon" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL If the moon and the Sun followed exactly the same path across the sky, eclipses of both kinds would happen each month. Actually they are relatively rare, because the 5-degree angle between the paths only allows eclipses when Sun and moon are near one of the points where the paths intersect. The cycle from each new moon to next one takes 29.5 days, but the actual orbital period of the moon is only 27.3217 days. That is the time it takes the moon to return to (approximately) the same position among the stars. Why the difference? Suppose we start counting from the moment when the moon in its motion across the sky is just overtaking the Sun; we will call this the new moon," even though the thin crescent of the moon will only be visible some time later, and only shortly after sunset. Wait 27.3217 days: the moon has returned to approximately the same place in the sky, but the Sun has meanwhile moved away, on its annual journey around the heavens. It takes the moon about 2 more days to catch up with the Sun, to the position of the next new moon," which is why times of the new moon are separated by 29.5 days. The visible face of the moon has light and dark patches, which people interpreted in different ways, depending on their culture. Europeans see a face and talk of the man in the moon" while children in China and Thailand recognize the rabbit in the moon." All agree, however, that the moon does not change, that it always presents the same face to Earth. Does that mean the moon doesnt rotate? No, it does rotate  one rotation for each revolution around Earth! The accompanying drawings, covering half an orbit, should make this clear. In them we look at the moons orbit from high above the north pole, and imagine a clock dial around the moon, and a feature on it, marked by an arrow, which initially (bottom position in each drawing) points at 12 oclock. In the right drawing the marked feature continues to point at Earth, and as the moon goes around the Earth, it points to the hours 10, 8 and 6 on the clock dial. As the moon goes through half a revolution, it also undergoes half a rotation. If the moon did not rotate, the situation would be as in the left drawing. The arrow would continue to point in the 12-oclock direction, and after half an orbit, people on Earth would be able to see the other side of the moon. This does not happen. We need to go aboard a spaceship and fly halfway around the Moon before we get a view of its other side  as did the Apollo astronauts who took the picture below. This strange rotation of the moon is maintained because the moon is slightly elongated along the axis which points towards earth. To understand the effect we look at the motion of a body with a much more pronounced elongation  an artificial satellite with the shape of a symmetric dumbbell (see Figure 8.4). Illustration of the gravity gradient concept: the difference in the force of gravity experienced by parts of the satellite will cause it to line its axis of rotation perpendicular to its orbit around the earth. Itgg can be shown that if the forces on the dumbbell (or indeed on a satellite of any shape) are unbalanced, it rotates around its center of gravity. That point will be defined here URL , but in a symmetric dumbbell with two equal masses marked A and B, the center of gravity is right in the middle between them. Both masses A and B are attracted to the Earth, and if the attracting forces were equal, their tendencies to rotate the satellite (rotation moments" or torques") are equal and cancel each other, so that no rotation occurs. If however A starts closer to the center of Earth, the force on it is just a little stronger. Therefore the satellite will rotate until A is as close to Earth as it can be, which is a possible position of equilibrium. Of course, it may then overshoot its equilibrium position, and end up swinging back-and-forth like a pendulum, only slowly (like a pendulum) losing energy and settling down. The elongated moon acts like a dumbbell too. The rotating force which lines up the moon or an orbiting dumbbell is the difference between the pull on A and on B. It depends not on how strongly gravity pulls these masses, but on how rapidly the pull of gravity changes with distance  on the gravity gradient." Near Earth that is a gentle force, though still strong enough to line up elongated satellites. Among those was Triad, (URL Near a black hole or pulsar, though, the gravity-gradient force can be fierce enough to rip a spacecraft apart. Actually, the long axis of the Moon does not always point exactly to the center of the Earth, but swings back and forth around that direction, a motion known as liberation. Most of this is caused because the Moon rotates around its axis with a fixed period, while its motion around its orbit slows down far from Earth and speeds up close to it. This speeding up and slowing down is the result of Keplers 2nd law, discussed in section 12, and is a rather small effect, since the moons orbit is very close to circular. Because of liberation, even though at any time only half the Moon is visible, over time 59% can be seen, since it lets astronomers look at the Moon from slightly different viewing directions. Liberations are a rather specialized subject but if you want to know more about it, go to URL At times when only a narrow crescent of the Moon is seen (e.g. a new moon"), one can also see the rest of the Moon faintly outlined. The Sun now shines on almost all of the side of the moon turned away from Earth (those calling that the dark side of the moon" are quite wrong!) and therefore it also illuminates most of the side of the Earth facing the moon. If you were standing on the moon at that time, a  full Earth" would shine brightly in your sky, and the faint earthshine" of the darker part of the moon is just the reflection of some of that bright earthlight. Earthshine is of interest to scientists, because its brightness is contributed by all the factors which turn back sunlight before it manages to heat the Earthlight reflected from the ground and from clouds, and light scattered back by dust and small particles (aerosols") in the atmosphere. In a time when atmospheric scientists are trying to assess heating of the Earth by the greenhouse effect (URL The fraction of light reflected is hard to estimate theoretically, but earthshine allows it to be measured. According to recent reports (The Darkening Earth, Scientific American August 2004, p. 16), this fraction has been growing, reducing the amount of sunlight received by Earth and canceling about 1/3 of the greenhouse heating. 
When  Galileo (http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/ Ssolsys.htm#q1 	  Giovanni Riccioli in 1651 named the more prominent features after famous astronomers, while the large dark and smooth areas he called seas" or maria" (singular mare," mah-reh). Some of the names he used for the Moons crater are of persons discussed in Stargazers"Tycho (distinguished by bright streaks that radiate from it), Ptolemy (Ptolemaeus"), Copernicus, Kepler, Aristarchus, Hipparchus, Erathosthenes; Meton and Pythagoras are on the edge, near the northern pole. Late-comers who lived after the 17th century had to make do with left-overs: the craters Newton and Cavendish are at the southern edge of the visible disk, Goddard and Lagrange too are near the edge. Also,  Galilaei" is a small undistinguished crater (because of Galileos banishment?). However, since the Russians were the first to observe the rear side of the Moon, a prominent crater there bears the name of Tsiolkovsky, who at the end of the 19th century promoted the idea of spaceflight. What had created those strange round craters?" (Krater" is Greek for a bowl or wide-mouthed goblet.) They reminded some observers of volcanic craters on Earth, or better, of the large calderas" (cauldrons) formed by the internal collapse of volcanos, e.g. Crater Lake (URL We now know that the impact explanation was right. The craters are round because at the enormous velocities with which meteorites arrive, the impact resembles a local explosion, and the signature of the impact is determined by the energy released rather than by the momentum transmitted. Part of the evidence has come from the nicely rounded impact remnants found on Earth, e.g. Meteor Crater (Canyon Diablo) in Arizona and Manicouagan lake in Canada, in northern Quebec (see picture), which is about 100 km (60 miles) wide and 214 million years old. Note that rather than having a pit in its center, the Manicougan lake has a round island. After the impact, the land rose again to the level of its surroundings, pushed by fluid pressure of the material below it, which acts like a viscous fluid and tries to establish equilibrium between the different loads which it supports. (For another picture of Lake Manicouagan, and more about it, click here: URL Other solid bodies of the solar system also display round craters. On the large ice-covered moons of Jupiter, the return to equilibrium is much more pronounced, because ice sags and flows much more readily than rock. Those moons display palimpsest" (named so after scrolls of parchment that were recycled by having their original text scratched off) craters which are merely surface markings, because as time passed, the walls which originally existed sagged back onto the flat surface. In the centuries after Galileos discoveries, the Moon was extensively studied by astronomers using telescopes. One thing soon became clear: it had no atmosphere. When a star was eclipsed by the Moon, it vanished suddenly and its light showed no refraction or absorption by an atmosphere. Why? By the laws of motion, the Moon orbits not the center of the Earth, but the center of gravity of the Earth and Moon (this is discussed at URL , and the center of gravity is defined in URL Gravity is important for the retention of an atmosphere. It holds an atmosphere down, while heat is what can make it escape. Heat is related to atomic or molecular motion. In solids and liquids, atoms or molecules can vibrate around their average position. The higher the objects temperature, the more vigorous the motion, until the material boils or evaporates, at which point its particles shake loose altogether. In a gas atoms and molecules fly around randomly, colliding constantly (if the gas is as dense as it is in the atmosphere), and their collisions lead to a very good explanation (the kinetic theory of gases") of the observed properties of a gas. The average velocity of a gas molecule depends on the temperature of the gas, and at room temperature it is comparable to that of the speeding bullet, quite below the escape velocity" needed for escaping Earths gravity. However, that is just an average: actual velocities are expected to be distributed around that average, following the  Maxwellian distribution" first derived by James Clerk Maxwell, whom we meet again in the discovery of the three color theory of light (URL For Earth, their number is too small to matter, but with the Moon, having only 1/6 of the surface gravity, it can be shown that any atmosphere would be lost within geological time. The planet Mercury, only slightly larger, also lacks any atmosphere, while Mars, with 1/3 the Earths surface gravity, only retains a very thin atmosphere. Water evaporates easily and once in gas form, is quickly lost by the same process. That suggested the maria" could not possibly be oceans, though their name remained. They actually turned out to be basaltic flows, hardened lava which long ago flowed out of fissures on the Moon; no present-day volcanism on the Moon has been reliably identified. The vast majority of craters probably date back to the early days of the solar system, because the lava of the maria has very few craters on it, suggesting it flooded and obliterated older ones. The picture of a dry Moon was reinforced by Moon rocks brought back by US astronauts. Earth rocks may contain water bound chemically (water of hydration"), but not these. Water, of course, would be essential to any human outpost on the Moon. Yet small amounts of water may still exist, brought by comets which occasionally hit the Moon. All this water is sure to evaporate in the heat of the collision, but some of it may re-condense in deep craters near the Moons pole, which are permanently in the shade and therefore extremely cold. Observations by the Clementine" spacecraft suggest that one such crater may indeed contain a layer of ice. From the beginning of spaceflight, the Moon was a prime target, but this chapter in space exploration is too long to be covered here in any detail. The first spacecraft to reach the Moon were Luna 1, 2 and 3 of the Soviet Union, in 1959. Of these, Luna 3 rounded the Moon, took photographs of the far side which is not seen from Earth, and later scanned and transmitted those images (see Figure 9.2); unfortunately, their quality was poor. In the decade that followed, 19 other Soviet missions were aimed at the Moon. In 1970 a Soviet spacecraft landed and returned a rock sample, and later that year a remotely controlled Lunokhod" (literally: moon-walker, shown in Figure 9.3) vehicle was landed, exploring its surroundings for nearly a year. Other sample returns and Lunokhods followed, the series ending in 1976. However, failures marked tests of a large rocket developed for human Moon flights, ending any plans of manned lunar exploration by the Soviet Union. Early attempts by the US to send unmanned spacecraft to the Moon (1958-64) either failed or returned scanty data. In July 1964, however, Ranger 7 returned clear TV pictures of its impact on the Moon, as did Rangers 8 and 9. Of the 7 soft landers" in the Surveyor" series (1966-8), 5 performed well and sent back data and pictures. In November 1969, after Apollo 12 landed 500 feet (160 meters) from the Surveyor 3" lander, astronauts retrieved its camera and brought if back to Earth. In addition to the Surveyor project, 5 lunar orbiters photographed the Moon and helped produce accurate maps of its surface. On May 25, 1961, about one month after Russias Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the globe, US president John F. Kennedy proposed to the US Congress that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. " The Apollo missions followed, with Apollo 8 rounding the Moon in 1968 and Apollo 11 finally landing there, on July 20, 1969 (pictured in Figure 9.4). Five other lunar landings followed, the last of them in December 1972. Only Apollo 13 failed to land, its crew members narrowly escaping with their lives after an explosion aboard their craft on the way to the Moon. Apollo 11 Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the Second Man on the Moon. Among the activities of Apollo astronauts on the Moon were: Bringing back to Earth extensive samples of lunar rock and soil. The rocks turned out to be ancient, suggesting no significant change since the surface of the Moon formed, about 4.5 billion years ago. The soil" (regolith) had probably been pulverized by impacts, but as the Surveyor" missions showed, it was firm enough to provide support. Crews of Apollo 15, 16 and 17 explored the Moon aboard an electrically driven moon buggy. " Extensive video pictures from the Moon were beamed to Eartheven one (by a remotely controlled camera) of the take-off from the Moon by the Apollo 17 crew. Also, the Earth and its geocorona" of glowing hydrogen were photographed by a special camera using ultraviolet light. A seismometer was placed on the Moon, showing that the Moon was seismically much quieter than Earth. Metal foils were hung out (like a flag) to receive the solar wind. They were then returned to Earth where the composition of the ions caught in them was analyzed. Corner reflectors were placed on the Moon, so that laser beams reflected from them could accurately measure the distance. No humans have visited the Moon from 1972 until now, but some orbital missions have studied the Moons magnetic field as well as X-ray and gamma-ray emissions, from which some variations of the surface composition could be inferred. The Moon was found to have no global magnetic field like the Earth, but its surface was weakly magnetized in some patches. Molten rock can become permanently magnetized if it solidifies in the presence of an external magnetic field, suggesting that in some ancient era the Moon, like Earth now, had a molten metallic core in which electric currents generated a magnetic field. Somewhat similar observations were made near Mars in 1998-2000. Some excitement was caused by indications from the Lunar Prospector (URL At the end of its mission, on July 31, 1999, Lunar Prospector was therefore steered to deliberately crash inside the crater. It was hoped the impact might create (briefly) a cloud of water vapor, which could be observed from Earth, but none was detected (URL There is little doubt that the future will see further lunar exploration, though a lunar base" is probably far off. Astronomical and other observations can readily be made from Earth orbit, and providing life support on the Moon is not easy. Such a base will probably become attractive only after ways are developed for utilizing local lunar materials for construction and for fuel.

Latitude and  Longitude 	  Any location on Earth is described by two numbers its latitude and its longitude. If a pilot or a ships captain wants to specify position on a map, these are the coordinates they would use. Actually, these are two angles, measured in degrees, minutes of arc and seconds of arc. These are denoted by symbols e.g. 35? 43 9" means an angle of 35 degrees, 43 minutes and 9 seconds (do not confuse this with the notation (,") for feet and inches!). A degree contains 60 minutes of arc and a minute contains 60 seconds of arc and you may omit the words of arc where the context makes it absolutely clear that these are not units of time. Calculations often represent angles by small letters of the Greek alphabet, and that way latitude will be represented by ? (lambda, Greek L), and longitude by ? (phi, Greek F). Here is how they are defined. PLEASE NOTE: Charts used in ocean navigation often use the OPPOSITE notation ? for LONGITUDE and ? for LATITUDE. The convention followed here resembles the one used by mathematicians in 3 dimensions for spherical polar coordinates (URL . An illustration of longitude and latitude. Imagine the Earth was a transparent sphere (actually the shape is slightly oval; because of the Earths rotation, its equator bulges out a little). Through the transparent Earth we can see its equatorial plane, and its middle the point is O, the center of the Earth. To specify the latitude of some point P on the surface, draw the radius OP to that point. Then the elevation angle of that point above the equator is its latitude ?  northern latitude if north of the equator, southern (or negative) latitude if south of it. How can one define the angle between a line and a plane, you may well ask? After all, angles are usually measured between two lines! Good question. We must use the angle which completes it to 90 degrees, the one between the given line and one perpendicular to the plane. Here that would be the angle (90?-?) between OP and the Earths axis, known as the co-latitude of P. On a globe of the Earth, lines of latitude are circles of different size. The longest is the equator, whose latitude is zero, while at the polesat latitudes 90? north and 90? south (or -90?) the circles shrink to a point. On the globe, lines of constant longitude (meridians) extend from pole to pole, like the segment boundaries on a peeled orange. Every meridian must cross the equator. Since the equator is a circle, we can divide it like any circle into 360 degrees, and the longitude ? of a point is then the marked value of that division where its meridian meets the equator. What that value is depends of course on where we begin to count on where zero longitude is. For historical reasons, the meridian passing the old Royal Astronomical Observatory in Greenwich, England, is the one chosen as zero longitude. Located at the eastern edge of London, the British capital, the observatory is now a public museum and a brass band stretching across its yard marks the prime meridian. Tourists often get photographed as they straddle itone foot in the eastern hemisphere of the Earth, the other in the western hemisphere. A lines of longitude is also called a meridian, derived from the Latin meri, a variation of medius which denotes middle, and diem, meaning day. The word once meant noon, and times of the day before noon were known as ante meridian, while times after it were post meridian. Todays abbreviations a.m. and p.m. come from these terms, and the Sun at noon was said to be passing meridian. All points on the same line of longitude experienced noon (and any other hour) at the same time and were therefore said to be on the same meridian line, which became meridian for short. Two important concepts, related to latitude and (especially) longitude are Local time (LT) and Universal time (UT). Local time is actually a measure of the position of the Sun relative to a locality. At 12 noon local time the Sun passes to the south and is furthest from the horizon (northern hemisphere). Somewhere around 6 am it rises, and around 6 pm it sets. Local time is what you and I use to regulate our lives locally, our work times, meals and sleep-times. But suppose we wanted to time an astronomical event e.g. the time when the 1987 supernova was first detected. For that we need a single agreed-on clock, marking time world-wide, not tied to our locality. That is universal time (UT), which can be defined (with some slight imprecision, no concern here) as the local time in Greenwich, England, at the zero meridian. Longitudes are measured from zero to 180? east and 180? west (or -180?), and both 180-degree longitudes share the same line, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. As the Earth rotates around its axis, at any moment one line of longitude  the noon meridian faces the Sun, and at that moment, it will be noon everywhere on it. After 24 hours the Earth has undergone a full rotation with respect to the Sun, and the same meridian again faces noon. Thus each hour the Earth rotates by 360/24 = 15 degrees. When at your location the time is 12 noon, 15? to the east the time is 1 p.m., for that is the meridian which faced the Sun an hour ago. On the other hand, 15? to the west the time is 11 a.m., for in an hours time, that meridian will face the Sun and experience noon. In the middle of the 19th century, each community across the US defined in this manner its own local time, by which the Sun, on the average, reached the farthest point from the horizon (for that day) at 12 oclock. However, travelers crossing the US by train had to re-adjust their watches at every city, and long distance telegraph operators had to coordinate their times. This confusion led railroad companies to adopt time zones, broad strips (about 15? wide) which observed the same local time, differing by 1 hour from neighboring zones, and the system was adopted by the nation as a whole. The continental US has 4 main time zones: eastern, central, mountain and western, plus several more for Alaska, the Aleut islands and Hawaii. Canadian provinces east of Maine observe Atlantic time; you may find those zones outlined in your telephone book, on the map giving area codes. Other countries of the world have their own time zones; only Saudi Arabia uses local times, because of religious considerations. In addition, the clock is generally shifted one hour forward between April and October. This  daylight saving time allows people to take advantage of earlier sunrises, without shifting their working hours. By rising earlier and retiring sooner, you make better use of the sunlight of the early morning, and you can enjoy sunlight one hour longer in late afternoon. Suppose it is noon where you are and you proceed west and suppose you could travel instantly to wherever you wanted. Fifteen degrees to the west the time is 11 a.m., 30 degrees to the west, 10 a.m., 45 degrees9 a.m. and so on. Keeping this up, 180 degrees away one should reach midnight, and still further west, it is the previous day. This way, by the time we have covered 360 degrees and have come back to where we are, the time should be noon again yesterday noon. What happened? We got into trouble because longitude determines only the hour of the day not the date, which is determined separately. To avoid the sort of problem encountered above, the international date line has been established most of it following the 180th meridian where by common agreement, whenever we cross it the date advances one day (going west) or goes back one day (going east). That line passes the Bering Strait between Alaska and Siberia, which thus have different dates, but for most of its course it runs in mid-ocean and does not inconvenience any local time keeping. Astronomers, astronauts and people dealing with satellite data may need a time schedule which is the same everywhere, not tied to a locality or time zone. The Greenwich mean time, the astronomical time at Greenwich (averaged over the year) is generally used here. It is sometimes called Universal Time (UT). The globe of the heavens resembles the globe of the Earth, and positions on it are marked in a similar way, by a network of meridians stretching from pole to pole and of lines of latitude perpendicular to them, circling the sky. To study some particular galaxy, an astronomer directs the telescope to its coordinates. On Earth, the equator is divided into 360 degrees, with the zero meridian passing Greenwich and with the longitude angle ? measured east or west of Greenwich, depending on where the corresponding meridian meets the equator. In the sky, the equator is also divided into 360 degrees, but the count begins at one of the two points where the equator cuts the ecliptic the one which the Sun reaches around March 21. It is called the vernal equinox (vernal means related to spring in Latin) or sometimes the first point in Aries, because in ancient times, when first observed by the Greeks, it was in the zodiac constellation of Aries, the ram. It has since then moved, as is discussed in the later section on precession (URL The celestial globe, however, uses terms and notations which differ somewhat from those of the globe of the Earth. Meridians are marked by the angle ? (alpha, Greek A), called right ascension, not longitude. It is measured from the vernal equinox, but only eastward, and instead of going from 0 to 360 degrees, it is specified in hours and other divisions of time, each hour equal to 15 degrees. Similarly, where on Earth latitude goes from 90? north to 90? south (or -90?), astronomers prefer the co-latitude, the angle from the polar axis,equal to 0? at the north pole, 90? on the equator, and 180? at the south pole. It is called declination and is denoted by the letter ? (delta, Greek small D). The two angles (?, ?), used in specifying (for instance) the position of a star are jointly called its celestial coordinates. The next section tells how the stars, the Sun and accurate clocks allowed sailors to find their latitude and longitude. 
Sea  Fever by  John  Masefield 	  How does a captain determine a ships position in mid-ocean? In our space age, this is easily done, by using the GPS system of satellitesthe Global Positioning System (URL Before the space age, however, it was not as easy. One had to use the Sun and the stars. Imagine yourself standing at night at point P on Earth and observing the pole star (or better, the position of the north celestial pole, near that star), at an elevation angle ? above the horizon. The angle of the pole star above the horizon equals the local latitude. The angle between the direction of the pole and the zenith is then 90? ?? degrees. If you continue the line from zenith downwards it reaches the center of the Earth, and the angle between it and the Earths axis is also 90? ??. Therefore, as the accompanying figure shows, ? is also your latitude. If you are sailing a ship in mid-ocean, you can get the same information from the noontime Sun  probably more accurately, since at night you might not see the horizon very well. Noon is when the Sun reaches the highest point in its journey across the sky. It then crosses the north-south direction in the northern hemisphere, usually south of the observer. Because the axis of the Earth is inclined by an angle e = 23.5? to a line perpendicular to the ecliptic, the height of that point above the horizon depends on the season. Suppose you are at point P. We examine 3 possibilities: (1) Suppose the date is the winter solstice, around December 21, when the north pole is inclined away from the Sun. To find your latitude ? you measure the angle a between the direction of the noontime Sun and the zenith. Look at the drawing and imagine you could rotate the equator and the north pole N until they reached the ecliptic and the pole of the ecliptic N0. Then all three angles marked e fold up together, showing that they are equal. You get a =?+e and your latitude is ?= a?e = a?23.5? (2) Half a year later, at the summer solstice (June 21), the north pole is inclined towards the Sun, not away from it, and now (if ? is larger than e) a =??e and your latitude is ?= a+e = a+23.5? (3) Finally, suppose you are at equinox, around March 21 or September 21. The inclination of the Earths axis is now out of the plane of the drawing  away from the paper, if this were a picture in a book. The direction to the Sun is in the plane of the equator, and we get ?= a Thus at least at those dates, seafarers could tell what their latitude was by measuring the position of the noontime Sun. For any other date, navigation tables exist that give the proper angle (smaller than 23.5 degrees) which must be added or subtracted. They also provide formulas for deriving the height of the noontime Sun from observations made at other times. As with the pole star, rather than measuring the angle a from the zenith  which is not marked in the sky!  it is simpler to measure the angle (90a) from the horizon, which at sea is usually sharply defined. Such observations, known as shooting the Sun," are done with an instrument known as the sextant. It has a sliding scale covering 1/6 of a circle (hence the name) and an attached pivoted mirror, providing a split view: by moving the scale, the sea-officer brings Sun and horizon simultaneously into view and then reads off the angle between them. Position of the noon Sun at equinox. In the age of the great navigators  of Columbus, Magellan, Drake, Frobisher, Bering and others  finding your latitude was the easy part. Captains knew how to use the noontime Sun, and before the sextant was invented, a less precise instrument known as the cross-staff was widely used. Longitude was a much harder nut to crack. In principle, all one needs is an accurate clock, set to Greenwich time. When the Sun passes the meridian" at noon, we only need to check the clock: if Greenwich time is 3 p.m., we know that 3 hours ago it was noon at Greenwich and we are therefore at longitude 15? 3 = 45 degrees west. However, accurate clocks require a fairly sophisticated technology. Pendulum clocks can keep time quite accurately on firm land, but the pitching and rolling of a ship makes them quite unsuitable for sea duty. Non-pendulum clocks  e.g. wristwatches, before they became electronic  use a balance wheel, a small flywheel rotating back and forth through a small angle. A flat spiral spring is wrapped around its axis and it always brings the wheel back to its original position. The period of each back-and-forth oscillation is then only determined by the strength of the spring and the mass of the wheel, and it can replace the swing of the pendulum in controlling the motion of the clocks hands. Gravity plays no role here, and motions of the ship also have very little effect; as discussed in a later section, a vaguely similar method was used in 1973 for weighing" astronauts in the weightless environment of a space station. For navigation, however, such a clock must be very accurate, which is not easy to achieve: friction must be minimal, and so must changes in the dimensions of the balance wheel and properties of the spring due to changing temperature and other factors. In the 17th and 18th century, when the navies of Britain, Spain, France and Holland all tried to dominate the seas, the problem of longitude" assumed great strategic importance and occupied some of the best scientific minds. In 1714 Britain announced a prize of 20,000 pounds  a huge sum in those days  for a reliable solution, and John Harrison, a British clockmaker, spent decades trying to achieve it. His first two  chronometers," of 1735 and 1739, though accurate, were bulky and delicate pieces of machinery; they have been restored and are ticking away on public display, at the Royal Astronomical Observatory in Greenwich. Only his 4th instrument, tested in 1761, proved satisfactory, and it took some additional years before he received his prize. Robert Wood was a professor at Johns Hopkins University during the first half of the 20th century, distinguished for his work on physical optics and also for his sense of humor and his love of mischievous tricks. In September 1917, Wood and some colleagues embarked for Europe aboard the steamship Adriatic, to help US allies use science in fighting World War I. To hinder German submarines from intercepting the ship, it location was kept secret from everybody, including its passengers. What follows are Woods own notes, reproduced in Doctor Wood" by William Seabrook (1940). The book is out of print, but remains worth reading (if you can find it) for its great store of stories, of which this one is a fair sample. We sailed on night after night, the weather growing colder and colder, and the North Star climbing towards the zenith. One afternoon it occurred to Colpitts [one of the traveling scientists] that it was the night of the autumnal equinox, on which both longitude and latitude can be calculated from the elevation of the North Star and the time of sunset [6 hours after noon]. I made a quadrant out of two sticks of wood and a protractor. By sighting one stick on the horizon and the other on the star, I determined its elevation, given which Colpitts, who had timed the sunset, worked out our position in a few minutes. This news spread rapidly, throwing the ships officers into a frenzy, as all information regarding the course we were sailing was a dead secret. Next morning we discovered the ships officers had set all of the clocks available to passengers three-quarters of an hour ahead, to confuse and baffle the scientists aboard." The calculation which enabled Wood and Colpitts to determine the ships position is described in the lesson plan provided for teachers and accompanying the present web page (URL Once radio arrived on the scene, early in the 20th century, the accuracy of chronometers became less critical, because broadcast time signals allowed shipboard timepieces to be reset periodically. But until then chronometers were essential to accurate navigation, as the following story illustrates. In 1893 the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen set out towards the north pole (located in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean) in a specially strengthened ship, the Fram." Having studied the currents of the Arctic Ocean, Nansen allowed Fram" to be frozen into the polar ice, with which it slowly drifted across the water. Nearly two years, later, realizing that the course of Fram" fell short of the pole, Nansen (who had prepared for this possibility) left the ship with his colleague Johansen and attempted to reach the pole by sleds over the ice. About 400 miles short of the pole they had to turn back: they wintered on a desolate island, in a hut they built of stones and walrus hides, and the following spring they headed for the islands of Svalbard (Spitzbergen). They had been in the icy wilderness for more than a year, completely out of touch, but they always knew exactly where they were, because each man carried a spring-powered chronometer. Then disaster struck  in a moment of distraction, both forgot to rewind their chronometers and allowed them to run down. Suddenly, they were lost! Based on their last recorded positions, they made a guess and reset their timepieces, but the rest of their journey was clouded by uncertainty. Luckily, they did not have much further to go, and as chance had it, they encountered a British Arctic expedition which took them home. Fram" broke free from the edge of the ice at about the same time; it is now on public display in Oslo. 
Coordinates 	  Coordinates are sets of numbers that describe position  position along a line, on a surface or in space. Latitude and longitude, or declination and right ascension, each is a system of coordinates on the surface of a sphere  on the globe of the Earth or the globe of the heavens. A more widely used system are cartesian coordinates, based on a set of axes perpendicular to each other. They are named for Rene Descartes (Day-cart"), a French scientist and philosopher who back in the 1600s devised a systematic way of labeling each point on a flat plane by a pair of numbers. You may well be already familiar with it. The system is based on two straight lines (axes"), perpendicular to each other, each of them marked with the distances from the point where they meet (origin")  distances to the right of the origin and above it, the origin being taken as positive and on the other sides as negative. Graphs use this system, as do some maps. This works well on a flat sheet of paper, but the real world is 3-dimensional and sometimes it is necessary to label points in 3-dimensional space. The cartesian (x,y) labeling can be extended to 3 dimensions by adding a third coordinate z. If (x,y) is a point on the sheet, then the point (x,y,z) in space is reached by moving to (x,y) and then rising a distance z above the paper (points below it have negative z). Very simple and clear, once a decision is made on which side of the sheet z is positive. By common agreement the positive branches of the (x,y,z) axes, in that order, follow the thumb and the first two fingers of the right hand when extended in a way that they make the largest angles with each other. Cartesian coordinates (x,y) are not the only way of labeling a point P on a flat plane by a pair of numbers. Other ways exist, and they can be more useful in special situations. One system ( polar coordinates") uses the length r of the line OP from the origin to P (i. e. the distance of P distance to the origin) and the angle that line makes with the x-axis. Angles are often denoted by Greek letters, and here we follow conventions by marking it with ?. Note that while in the cartesian system x and y play very similar roles, here roles are divided: r gives distance and ? direction. The two representations are closely related. From the definitions of the sine and cosine: x = rcos? y = rsin? This allows (x,y) to be derived from polar coordinates. This relationship is illustrated below: To go in the reverse direction, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find r: r2 = x2+y2 Once r is known, the rest is easy: x cos?= r y sin?= r These relations fail only at the origin, where x = y = r = 0. At that point, ? is undefined and one can choose for it whatever one pleases. In three dimensional space, the cartesian labeling (x,y,z) is nicely symmetric, but sometimes it is convenient to follow the style of polar coordinates and label distance and direction separately. Distance is easy: you take the line OP from the origin to the point and measure its length r. You can even show from the theorem of Pythagoras that in this case r2 = x2+y2+z2 All the points with the same value of r form a sphere of radius r around the origin O. On a sphere we can label each point by latitude ? (lambda, small Greek L) and longitude ? (phi, small Greek F), so that the position of any point in space is defined by the 3 numbers (r,?,?). An old surveyors telescope (theodolite). The surveyors telescope is designed to measure two such angles. The angle ? is measured counterclockwise in a horizontal plane, but surveyors (and soldiers) work with azimuth, a similar angle measured clockwise from north. Thus the directions (north, east, south, west) have azimuth (0, 90, 180, 270). A rotating table allows the telescope to be pointed in any azimuth. The angle ? is called elevation and is the angle by which the telescope is lifted above the horizontal (if it looks down, ? is negative). The two angles together can in principle specify any direction: ? ranges from 0 to 360, and ? from 90 (straight down or nadir") to +90 (straight up or zenith"). Again, one needs to decide from what direction is the azimuth measuredthat is, where is azimuth zero? The rotation of the heavens (and the fact most humanity lives north of the equator) suggests (for surveyor-type measurements) the northward direction, and this is indeed the usual zero point. The azimuth angle (viewed from the north) is measured counterclockwise. 
The  Cross  Staff 	  The picture above is meant to represent the astronomer Claudius Ptolemy (an early champion of the geocentric model), who lived around 150 AD. It is an old picture, though not old enough for the artist to have actually known what Ptolemy looked like. But what is that gentleman holding? It isnt a religious symbol  the proportions are not right, and the marks on the stick do not seem appropriate. It is actually a cross staff (or Jacobs staff"), a tool widely used by astronomers and navigators before the invention of the telescope, and for a while afterwards. It consists of a main staff with a perpendicular crosspiece, attached at its middle to the staff and able to slide up and down along it. The device was likely invented by Rabbi Levi ben Gershon (1288-1344), a Jewish scholar who lived in Provence, in southern France, also referred to as Gersonides." Claudius Ptolemy lived more than 1000 years earlier, so the drawing on top indeed takes considerable artistic license. Astronomers used the cross-staff for measuring the angle between the directions of two stars. Other, older instruments for this purpose existed, used by scholars such as Hipparchos and Ptolemy, but none was as portable, which made the cross-staff eminently suitable for navigation at sea. Ships officers used it to measure the elevation angle of the noontime Sun above the horizon, which allowed them to estimate their latitude (see section on navigation). The problem of getting dazzled by the Sun later led to the invention of the backstaff, where the sunlight fell onto a target, not into the eye. Columbus may well have used one. This was greatly improved around 1594 by Captain John Davis, so perhaps the Mayflower" used the upgraded design. To measure the angle between two stars, an astronomer would place the staff just below one eye (see Figure 13.2) and slide the cross-piece up and down. The cross-piece would have a pair of open sights sticking out perpendicular to the drawing at symmetric locations such as B and B (often several pairs of sights, some spaced further apart than others). The astronomer would slide the cross-piece up and down, until sight B covered one of the stars and sight B the other. For use at night, slits make convenient sights. After that was achieved, the instrument would be lowered and the distance AC would be measured. Then if ? was the angle between the staff and the direction of one star, from the definition of the tangent: 
 	  tan(?)= 
 	  The distance BC between the sight and the stick was already known to the astronomer  so, using a table of tangents, the angle denoted by ? could be calculated. Since the instrument was symmetric, the angle between the directions of the stars was 2?. 
The  Calendar 	  So familiar has the calendar become that people tend to forget that it, too, had to be invented. Early farmers needed to know when to plow and sow ahead of rainy seasons, and to time other seasonal activities. Early priests in Babylonia, Egypt, China and other countries, even among the Maya in America, examined therefore the motions of the Sun, Moons and planets across the sky, and came up with a variety of calendars, some still in use. The basic unit is obviously the day: 24 hours, 1440 minutes, 86400 seconds, each second slightly longer than the average heartbeat. The day is defined by the motion of the Sun across the sky, and a convenient benchmark is noon, the time when the Sun is at its highest (i. e. most distant from the horizon) and is also exactly south or north of the observer. One day" can therefore be conveniently defined as the time from one noon to the next. A sundial can track the Suns motion across the sky by the shadow of a rod or fin (gnomon") pointing to the celestial pole (See the chapter Making a Sundial" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL for construction of a folded-paper sundial), allowing the day to be divided into hours and smaller units. Noon is the time when the shadow points exactly south (or north) and is at its shortest. What then is the period of the Earths rotation around its axis? A day, you might guess? Not quite. Suppose we observe the position of a star in the sky  for instance Sirius, the brightest of the lot. One full rotation of the Earth is the time it takes for the star to return to its original position (of course, we are the ones that move, not the star). That is almost how the day is defined, but with one big difference: for the day, the point of reference is not a star fixed in the firmament, but the Sun, whose position in the sky slowly changes. During the year the Sun traces a full circle around the sky, so that if we keep a separate count of Sirius days" and Sun days, at the end of the year the numbers will differ by 1. We will get 366. 2422 star days" but only 365. 2422 Sun days. It is the star day" (sidereal day) which gives the rotation period of the Earth, and it is about 4 minutes shy of 24 hours. A clockwork designed to make a telescope follow the stars makes one full rotation per sidereal day. The clocks we know and use, though, are based on the solar day  more precisely, on the average solar day, because the time from noon to noon can vary as the Earth moves in its orbit around the Sun. By Keplers laws (discussed in a later section:URL Very precise atomic clocks nowadays tell us that the day is gradually getting longer. The culprits are the tides, twin waves raised in the Earths ocean by (mainly) the Moons gravitational pull. As the waves travel around the Earth, they break against shorelines and shallow seas, and thus give up their energy: theory suggests that this energy comes out of the (kinetic) energy of the Earths rotational motion. The year is the time needed by the Earth for one full orbit around the Sun. At the end of that time, the Earth is back to the same point in its orbit, and the Sun is therefore back to the same apparent position in the sky. It takes the Earth 365. 2422 days to complete its circuit (average solar days), and any calendar whose year differs from this number will gradually wander through the seasons. The ancient Roman calendar had 355 days but added a month every 2 or 4 years: it wasnt good enough, and by the time Julius Caesar became ruler of Rome, it had slipped by three months. In 46 BC Caesar introduced a new calendar, named after him: the Julian calendar. It is similar to the one used today: the same 12 months, and an added day at the end of February every 4th year (leap year"), on years whose number is divisible by 4. Two years afterwards the 5th month of the Roman year was renamed July, in honor of Julius. The name of his successor, Augustus Caesar, was later attached to the month following July. The Julian calendar thus assumes a year of 365. 25 days, leaving unaccounted a difference of 0. 0078 days or about 1/128 of a day. Thus the calendar still slips, but at a very slow rate, about one day in 128 years. By 1582 that slippage was approaching two weeks and Pope Gregory the 13th therefore decreed a modified calendar, named after him: the Gregorian calendar. Henceforth years ending in two zeros, such as 1700, 1800, 1900would not be leap years, except when the number of centuries was divisible by 4, such as 2000. This took away 3 leap days" every 400 years, i. e. one day per 133 1/3 years  close enough to the required correction of one day per 128 years. But it was not enough to modify the calendar: a one-time jump of dates was also needed, to get rid of the accumulated difference. In Italy this was done soon after the popes edict, and Tibaldo and the Hole in the Calendar" by Abner Shimony spins the story of a boy whose birthday was on a day skipped by that jump. Another birthday affected was that of George Washington, born February 11, 1732: when the British empire in September 1752 implemented the Gregorian calendar, the 11th of February old style" became the 22nd of February new style," and nowadays that is when Washingtons birthday is usually celebrated. In Russia the change came only after the revolution, which is why the Soviet government used to celebrate the anniversary of the October Revolution" on November 7th. The Russian orthodox church continues to use the Julian calendar and celebrates Christmas and Easter about 2 weeks later than most of the Christian world. The Moons orbital period, measured by the stars (sidereal period") is 27. 321662 days. However, the monthly cycle of the Moon  thin crescent to half-moon, to full and back to crescent  takes 29. 530589 days, because it depends on the position of the Sun in the sky, and that position changes appreciably in the course of each orbit. The different shapes of the Moon represent different angles of illumination, and the appearance of the Moon in the night sky gives a fair idea of where the Sun would be (e. g. the Moon observed in the east before sunrise appears illuminated from below). The duration of the Moons cycle (synodic period") gave rise to the division of time known as month. Many ancient calendars were based on the month. The most successful of these is the Metonic" calendar, named after the Greek Meton, who noted that adding 7 months in the course of 19 years kept the calendar almost exactly in step with the seasons. That would make the length of the average year (12 + 7/19) months, and with a calculator you can easily find its value as pretty close to the full value 365. 2422. The Metonic calendar is thus more accurate than the Julian one, though less so than the Gregorian. It is still used by Jews, on whose calendar each month begins at or near the new moon, when the Moons position in the sky is nearest to the Suns. The traditional Chinese calendar also uses of a formula like Metons, which was probably invented by the ancient Babylonians. For more about the ancient Babylonian calendar see URL . Muslims use an uncorrected lunar calendar, and as a result their holidays slip through the seasons at a rate of about 11 days per year. The reason is not ignorance of astronomy, but a deliberate effort to follow a different schedule from that of any other faith. This creates an interesting situation during the month of Ramadan, when faithful Muslims are expected to fast and abstain from drinking from sunrise to sunset. When Ramadan falls in mid-winter, this imposes no great hardship, since days are short and cool. Fifteen years later, however, Ramadan falls in mid-summer, when days are long and the heat makes people quite thirsty. That is when many in Arab cities wait impatiently for the boom of the cannon which traditionally announces every evening the end of the fast. 
Ah, but my  Computations,  People say 	  Reduced the Year to better reckoning Nay, 
Rubaiyat, verse #57, by  Omar  Khayyam 	  A calendar which tracks the solar year even better than the Gregorian one is the Persian (Iranian) calendar, the first version of which was devised by Omar Khayyam (1044-1123), author of the famous Rubaiyat" poems, masterfully translated in 1839 into English by Edward Fitzgerald. It is also called the Jalali calendar, after the king Malik Shah Jalaludin who in 1074 assigned Omar and 7 other scholars to devise a new calendar. Though the count of Persian years starts, like the Islamic one, from the flight of Mohammed to Medina in 622, establishing there the first strong base of Islam, the new year starts at the spring equinox, March 21, with the holiday of Nowruz. The Persian year itself has 12 months  the first 6 have 31 days, the next 5 have 30 days, and the last has 28 or 29, depending on whether the year is or isnt a leap year. Each month corresponds to a sign of the zodiac. The number of days in each month (if not the order of months) is therefore the same as in the Western civil calendar. The difference is in the rule for determining leap year, which is more complex. Even the original Jalali calendar was more accurate than the Gregorian one; the current version assigns 683 leap years in a cycle of 2820 years and would take two million years before it shows a one-day inaccuracy! An interesting related calendar is used by the Coptic Christian church in Ethiopia, with 12 months of 30 days each, plus a 13th short month of 5 days. A tourist brochure once lured visitors with a promise Come to Ethiopia and enjoy 13 months of sunshine a year." The Maya Indians in Central America, living on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, Belize and Guatemala (where Maya languages are still spoken), created an extensive civilization which peaked around the years 1200-1450. They developed an early system of symbolic writing (glyphs") and mathematics, using a system like ours (including the zero!) but based on the number 20 instead of 10. They did not, however, use fractions. Their astronomy was well developed, and they noted the zenial days" when the Sun was directly overhead (at zenith") and a vertical stick cast no shadow. Their year had 365 days, but in the absence of leap years it slowly shifted with respect to the solstices. That year was divided into 18 named months" of 20 days each (numbered from 0 to 19), plus the short month" of Wayeb, whose days were considered unlucky. Yucatan does not experience summer and winter the way middle latitudes do (e.g. Europe or most of the US), and therefore the Maya calendar was not strongly tied to the seasons the way ours is. The planet Venus received major attention, and its cycles were accurately measured by Maya astronomers. In addition the Maya also observed a ritual year" of 260 days, consisting of 20 named long weeks" of 13 numbered days each.

Precession 	  The priests of ancient Babylonia and Egypt were also pioneer astronomers. They studied the heavens, mapped their constellations, identified the path of the Sun and estimated the periods of the Moon and Sun as they moved across the sky. But it was a Greek astronomer, Hipparchus of Nicea, who made the first major new discovery in astronomy. Comparing observations more than a century apart, Hipparchus proposed that the axis around which the heavens seemed to rotate shifted gradually, though very slowly. Viewed from Earth, the Sun moves around the ecliptic, one full circuit each year. Twice a year, at equinox, day and night are equal and the Sun rises exactly in the east and sets exactly in the west. Ancient astronomers had no good clocks and could not tell when the day and night had the same length, but they could identify the equinox by the Sun rising exactly in the east and setting exactly in the west. At those times the Suns position is at one of the intersections between the ecliptic and the celestial equator. Around the year 130 BC, Hipparchus compared ancient observations to his own and concluded that in the preceding 169 years those intersections had moved by 2 degrees. How could Hipparchus know the position of the Sun among the stars so exactly, when stars are not visible in the daytime? By using not the Sun but the shadow cast by the Earth on the moon, during an eclipse of the Moon! During an eclipse, Sun, Earth and Moon form a straight line, and therefore the center of the Earths shadow is at the point on the celestial sphere which is exactly opposite that of the Sun. Hipparchus concluded that the intersection marking the equinox slowly crept forward along the ecliptic, and called that motion  the precession of the equinoxes." The rate is about one full circle in 26 000 years. In ancient times the intersection marking the spring equinox was in the constellation of Aries, the ram, and for that reason the intersection (wherever it might be) is still sometimes called the first point in Aries." Around the year 1 it moved into the constellation of Pisces (pronounced pie-sees" in the US) and currently it is again in transition, to the constellation of Aquarius, the water carrier. If you ever heard the song The dawning of the age of Aquarius" from the musical Hair," that is what it is all about. To astronomers precession is mainly another factor to be taken into account when aiming a telescope or drawing a star chart; but to believers in astrology, the dawning of the age of Aquarius" is a great portent and may mark the beginning of a completely new and different era. What does this motion tell us about the Earths motion in space? If you ever had a spinning top, you know that its axis tends to stay lined up in the same direction  usually, vertically (left figure), though in space any direction qualifies. Precession of a spinning top: the spin axis traces the surface of a cone. Give it a nudge, however, and the axis will start to gyrate wildly around the vertical, its motion tracing a cone (right figure). The spinning Earth moves like that, too, though the time scale is much slower  each spin lasts a day, and each gyration around the cone takes 26 000 years. The axis of the cone is perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. The cause of the precession is the equatorial bulge of the Earth, caused by the centrifugal force of the Earths rotation (the centrifugal force is discussed in a later section). That rotation changes the Earth from a perfect sphere to a slightly flattened one, thicker across the equator. The attraction of the Moon and Sun on the bulge is then the nudge" which makes the Earth precess. Through each 26 000-year cycle, the direction in the sky to which the axis points goes around a big circle, the radius of which covers an angle of about 23.50. The pole star to which the axis points now (within about one degree) used to be distant from the pole, and will be so again in a few thousand years (for your information, the closest approach is in 2017). Indeed, the pole star" used by ancient Greek sailors was a different one, not nearly as close to the pole. Because of the discovery made by Hipparchus, the word precession" itself no longer means shift forward" but is now applied to any motion of a spin axis around a conefor instance, the precession of a gyroscope in an airplanes instrument, or the precession of a spinning satellite in space. Precession of a spinning scientific payload (also known as its coning"  from cone"  or its nutation") is Precession of the Earths axis. an unwelcome feature, because it complicates the tracking of its instruments. To eliminate it, such satellites use nutation dampers," small tubes partially filled with mercury. If the satellite spins as it was designed to do, the mercury merely flows to the part of the tube most distant from the spin axis, and stays there. However, if the axis of rotation precesses, the mercury sloshes back and forth in the tube. Its friction then consumes energy, and since the source of the sloshing is the precession of the spin axis, that precession (very gradually) loses energy and dies down. Note: In the section on the calendar, we saw that the Earths rotation is slowed down very gradually by the tides, raised by the gravity of the Moon. That process is a bit similar to the action of nutation dampers: the energy of the tides is lost"that is, converted to heatwhen the waves caused by tides break up on the seashore, and that loss is ultimately taken away from the rotational motion ( not the precession) of the Earth. Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. 
From what  Ive tasted of desire 	  I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, 
Robert  Frost 	  Some 2000 years after Hipparchus, in the year 1840. Louis Agassiz, a Swiss scientist, published a book on glaciers, a familiar feature of his homeland  huge rivers of ice created by accumulated snowfall, filling valleys and slowly creeping downwards to their end points, lakes of meltwater (or, in some other countries, the sea). Glaciers leave an imprint on the landscape: they scratch and grind down rocks, and carry loads of gravel, at times even big boulders, from the mountains to the plains, leaving them far from their origins, wherever the ice finally melts. Agassiz, who later became a distinguished professor at Harvard, noted that such imprints existed all over northern Europe, and suggested that the lands now inhabited by Germans, Poles, Russians and others used to be covered by enormous glaciers. America, too, had its glaciers; Cape Cod, for instance, is a left-over pile of glacial gravel. Later geological studies found evidence that such glaciers advanced and retreated several times in the last million years. The last retreat, a rather abrupt one, occurred about 12,000 years ago. The big questions are, of course, what caused those glaciers to spread, and will it happen again? Actually, no one is yet completely sure. But an intriguing idea, due to work in the 1930s by the Serbian astronomer Milutin Milankovich, may link them to the precession which Hipparchus discovered. As already noted, the Earths orbit is not perfectly round, but is slightly elongated. The Earth therefore comes closest to the Sun in the first week of January (the exact day varies a little). It means that just when the northern hemisphere experiences winter and receives the least amount of sunlight, the Earth as a whole receives the most (the swing is about 3%, peak to peak). This makes northern winters milder, and northern summers are milder too, since they occur when the Earth is most distant from the Sun. The opposite is true south of the equator: the beginning of January occurs there in summer, and therefore one expects southern summers to be hotter, and southern winters colder, than those north of the equator. This effect is however greatly weakened, because by far most of the southern hemisphere is covered by ocean, and the water tempers and moderates the climate. Right now, northern winter occurs in the part of the Earths orbit where the north end of the axis points away from the Sun. However, since the axis moves around a cone, 13,000 years from now, in this part of the orbit, it will point towards the Sun, putting it in mid-summer just when the Earth is closest to the Sun. The Earths current spin axis (solid) and its axis in 13,000 years (dashed). At that time one expects northern climate to be more extreme, and the oceans then have a much smaller effect, since the proportion of land in the northern hemisphere is much larger. Milankovich argued that because winters were colder, more snow fell, feeding the giant glaciers. Furthermore, he said, since snow was white, it reflected sunlight, and with more severe winters, the snow-covered land warmed up less effectively once winter had ended. Climate is maintained by a delicate balance between opposing factors, and Milankovich argued that this effect alone was enough to upset that balance and cause ice ages. Milankovich was aware that this was just one of several factors, since it turns out that ice ages do not recur every 26,000 year, nor do they seem common in other geological epochs. The eccentricity of the Earths orbit, which determines the closest approach to the Sun, also changes periodically, as does the inclination of the Earths axis to the ecliptic. But overall the notion that ice ages may be linked to the motion of the Earth through space may be currently our best guess concerning the causes of ice ages. Postscript, 28 July 1999. The magnitude of the Milankovich effect" depends on the difference between largest and smallest distances from the Sun. That, in its turn, depends on the eccentricity of the Earths orbit, which varies with a 100,000-year cycle, on which a 413,000-year cycle is superposed. J. Rial (Univ. of North Carolina) found signatures of those cycles in the oxygen isotope content of deep-sea sediments, in full agreement with the Milankovich theory. His work is in Science, vol. 285, p. 564, 23 July 1999; a non-technical explanation Why the Ice Ages Dont Keep Time " is on pages 503-504 of the same issue. Further note: The sea-bottom results have now been compared to hydrogen isotope ratios in deep boreholes in the ice sheets of Antarctica, which took nearly a million years to accumulate ( Science, 11 June 2004, p. 1609). Deep-sea sediments show that in the last million years, but not before, the variation is dominated by a periodicity around 100,000 years. Its origin, the article states, is one of the unanswered, yet fundamental questions." Ice cores could help explain it. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the position among the stars of the celestial pole  the pivot around which the celestial sphere seems to rotate  traces a circle every 26,000 years of so. The celestial pole is now quite close to the pole star Polaris, but it will not be so in the future, and wasnt in the past.

Chapter  Outline 	  Today it is well known that the Earth is a sphere, or very close to one (its equator bulges out a bit because of the Earths rotation). When Christopher Columbus proposed to reach India by sailing west from Spain, he too knew that the Earth was round. India was the source of precious spices and other rare goods, but reaching it by sailing east was difficult, because Africa blocked the way. On a round globe, however, it should also be possible to reach India by sailing west, and this Columbus proposed to do (he wasnt the first one to suggest thissee below). Sometimes the claim is made that those who opposed Columbus thought the Earth was flat, but that wasnt the case at all. Even in ancient times sailors knew that the Earth was round and scientists not only suspected it was a sphere, but even estimated its size. A ship not visible from the shore might be visible from a tree If you stand on the seashore and watch a ship sailing away, it will gradually disappear from view. But the reason cannot be the distance: if a hill or tower are nearby, and you climb to the top after the ship has completely disappeared, it becomes visible again. Furthermore, if on the shore you watch carefully the way the ship disappears from view, you will notice that the hull vanishes first, while the masts and sails (or the bridge and smokestack) disappear last. It is as if the ship was dropping behind a hill, which in a way is exactly the case, the hill" being the curve of the Earths surface. To find out how the distance to the horizon is calculated, please see the chapter Distance to the Horizon" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC) argued in his writings that the Earth was spherical, because of the circular shadow it cast on the Moon, during a lunar eclipse. Another reason was that some stars visible from Egypt are not seen further north The full quotation can be found at URL The Alexandria philosopher URL Eratosthenes went one step further and actually estimated how large the Earth was. He was told that on midsummer day (June 21) in the town of Syene in southern Egypt (today Aswan, near a huge dam on the river Nile) the noontime Sun was reflected in a deep well, meaning that it was right overhead, at zenith. Eratosthenes himself lived in Alexandria, near the rivers mouth, north of Syene, about 5000 stadia north of Syene (the stadium, the size of a sports arena, was a unit of distance used by the Greeks). In Alexandria the Sun on the corresponding date did not quite reach zenith, and vertical objects still threw a short shadow. Eratosthenes established that the direction of the noon Sun differed from the zenith by an angle that was 1/50 of the circle, that is, 7.2 degrees, and from that he estimated the circumference of the Earth to be 250,000 stadia. 
Tidbit 	  Eratosthenes also headed the royal library in Alexandria, the greatest and most famous library in classical antiquity. Officially it was called temple of the muses" or museion," from which our modern museum" is derived. Other estimates of the size of the Earth followed. Some writers reported that the Greek Posidonius used the greatest height of the bright star Canopus above the horizon, as seen from Egypt and from the island of Rhodes further north (near the southwestern tip of Turkey). He obtained a similar value, a bit smaller. The Arab Khalif El Mamun, who ruled in Baghdad from 813 to 833, sent out two teams of surveyors to measure a north-south baseline and from it also obtained the radius of the Earth. Compared to the value known today, those estimates were pretty close to the mark. The idea of sailing westward to India dates back to the early Romans. According to Dr. Irene Fischer, who studied this subject, the Roman writer Strabo, not long after Erathosthenes and Posidonius, reported their results and noted: if of the more recent measurements of the Earth, the one which makes the Earth smallest in circumference be introducedI mean that of Posidonius who estimates its circumference at about 180,000 stadia, then. . . " and he continues: Posidonius suspects that the length of the inhabited world, about 70,000 stadia, is half the entire circle on which it had been taken, so that if you sail from the west in a straight course, you will reach India within 70,000 stadia. " Notice that Strabofor unclear reasonsreduced the 250,000 Stadia of Eratosthenes to 180,000, and then stated that half of that distance came to just 70,000 stadia. Handling his numbers in that loose fashion, he could argue that India was not far to the west. All these results were known to the panel of experts which King Ferdinand appointed to examine the proposal made by Columbus. They turned Columbus down, because using the original value by Eratosthenes, they calculated how far India was to the west of Spain, and concluded that the distance was far too great. Columbus had an estimate of his own. Some historians have proposed that he used an argument like Strabos, but Dr. Fischer found his claim to be based on incorrect units of distance. Columbus used an erroneous estimate by Ptolemy (whom we meet again), who based it on a later definition of the stadium, and in estimating the size of the settled world he confused the Arab mile, used by El Mamun, with the Roman mile on which our own mile is based. All the same, his final estimate of the distance to India was close to Strabos. In the end Queen Isabella overruled the experts, and the rest is history. We may never know whether Columbus knowingly fudged his values to justify an expedition to explore the unknown, or actually believed India was not too far to the west of Spain. He certainly did call the inhabitants of the lands he discovered Indians," a mislabeling which still persists. But we do know that if the American continent had not existed, the experts would have been vindicated: Coumbus with his tiny ships could never have crossed an ocean as wide as the Atlantic and Pacific combined. In hindsight the exploration of the unknown may be justification enough! As for the size of the Earth, it was accurately measured many times since (see item geodesy" in an encyclopaedia), one notable effort being that of the French Academy of Sciences in the late 1700s. Their aim was to devise a new unit of distance, equal to one part in 10,000,000 of the distance from the pole to the equator (as Eratosthenes showed, it is enough to measure part of that distance). Nowadays that distance is known even more accurately, but the unit introduced by the French academy is still used as the standard of all distance measurements. It is called the meter.

Distance to the  Horizon 	  Imagine you were standing at an elevation of h meters above the ocean and looking out across the water. What is the distance D to the horizon? It can be calculated, if you know the radius R of the Earth. Illustration of the horizon calculation. Your line of sight to the horizon is a tangent to the Earth  a line which touches the sphere of the Earth at just one point, marked B in the drawing here. If O is the center of the sphere of the Earth, by a well-known theorem of geometry such a tangent is perpendicular to the radius OB, that is, it makes a 90? angle with it. It follows from applying the Pythagorean theorem to 4OAB that (OA)2 =(AB)2+(OB)2 or if the length of each line is spelled out, (R+h)2 = D2+R2 expanding the left side of the equation, we find 
R2+2 Rh+h2 =  D2+ R2 	  simplifying, we find Since the diameter 2R of the Earth is much bigger than h, we can replace (2R+h) by 2R without significantly affecting the results. Carrying out this replacement gives 
D =	2 Rh 	  This equation lets one calculate D  in kilometers, if h and R are given in kilometers. We can also rewrite is as ?	? ? 
Using  R = 6371 km, we find 	  ? 
D = 112.88 km h 	  If you are standing atop a mountain 1 km high, h = 1 km and your horizon should be 112.88 km away (we neglect the refraction of light in the atmosphere, which may modify this value). From the top of Mauna Kea on Hawaii, an extinct volcano about 4 km high (also the site of important astronomical observatories), the horizon should be about twice as distant, 226 km. On the other hand, standing on the beach with your eyes 2 meters = 0.002 km above the? water, since	0.002 = 0.04472, the horizon is only 5 km away. The calculation should also hold the other way around. From a boat on the ocean you should begin seeing the top of Mauna Kea after you pass a distance of 226 km (again, not accounting for refraction). On November 15, 1806, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike of the US Army, leading an exploration party across the plains of the midwestern US, saw through his spyglass the top of a distant peak, just above the horizon. It took his party a week to cover the 100 miles to the mountain, which is now known as Pikes Peak, one of the tallest in Colorado. Pike actually tried to climb to its top, but the snow and the unexpected height of the mountain forced him back. 
Parallax 	  The page at URL describes the basic problem of trigonometry (drawing above): finding the distance to some far-away point C, given the directions at which C appears from the two ends of a measured baseline AB. This problem becomes somewhat simpler if: The method presented here was already used by the ancient Greeks more than 2000 years ago. They knew that the length of a circle of radius r was 2?r, where ? (a modern notation, not one of the Greeks, even though ? is part of their alphabet) stands for a number a little larger than 3; approximately ?? 3.14159... (The Greek mathematician Archimedes derived ? to about 4-figure accuracy, though he expressed it differently, since decimal fractions appeared in Europe only some 1000 years later.) In this case (see Figure 18.2), we can approximate 4ABC as a slice of a much bigger circle; in this case, the length of the baseline is approximately equal to the length of the corresponding arc: c ? c0 There are 360 degrees in a circle and ? degrees in this particular arc; since 360 degrees corresponds to one circumference of arc length (2?r), ? degrees will correspond to an arclength of r Solving for r and plugging in c ? c0, we find r c We have solved for r in terms of c. For instance, if we know that ?? 6? (well see why this is relevant later), 2??= 36? and we get: r = 10c0 Here is a method useful to hikers and scouts. Suppose you want to estimate the distance to some distant landmark  e.g. a building, tree or water tower. The drawing shows a schematic view of the situation from above (not to scale). To estimate the distance to the landmark A, you do the following: Why does this work? Because even though people vary in size, the proportions of the average human body are fairly constant, and for most people, the angle between the lines from the eyes (A,B) to the outstretched thumb is about 6 degrees, for which the ratio 1:10 was found in an earlier part of this section. That angle is the parallax of your thumb, viewed from your eyes. The triangle ABC has the same proportions as the much larger triangle ABC, and therefore, if the distance BC to the thumb is 10 times the distance AB between the eyes, the distance AC to the far landmark is also 10 times the distance AB. When estimating the distance to a very distant object, our baseline" between the two points of observation better be large, too. The most distant objects our eyes can see are the stars, and they are very far indeed: light which moves at 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second, would take years, often many years, to reach them. The Suns light needs 500 seconds to reach Earth, a bit over 8 minutes, and about 5.5 hours to reach the average distance of Pluto, the most distant planet. A light year" is about 1600 times further, an enormous distance. The biggest baseline available for measuring such distances is the diameter of the Earths orbit, 300,000,000 kilometers. The Earths motion around the Sun makes it move back and forth in space, so that on dates separated by half a year, its positions are 300,000,000 kilometers apart. In addition, the entire solar system also moves through space, but that motion is not periodic and therefore its effects can be separated. And how much do the stars shift when viewed from two points 300,000,000 km apart? Actually, very, very little. For many years astronomers struggled in vain to observe the difference. Only in 1838 were definite parallaxes measured for some of the nearest stars  for Alpha Centauri by Henderson from South Africa, for Vega by Friedrich von Struve and for 61 Cygni by Friedrich Bessel. Such observations demand enormous precision. Where a circle is divided into 360 degrees (360?), each degree is divided into 60 minutes (60)also called minutes of arc" to distinguish them from minutes of timeand each minute contains 60 seconds of arc (60"). All observed parallaxes are less than 1", at the limit of the resolving power of even large ground-based telescopes. In measuring star distances, astronomers frequently use the parsec, the distance to a star whose yearly parallax is 1"  one second of arc. One parsec equals 3.26 light years, but as already noted, no star is that close to us. Alpha Centauri, the sun-like star nearest to our solar system, has a distance of 4.3 years and a parallax of 0.75". Alpha Centauri is not a name, but a designation. Astronomers designate stars in each constellation by letters of the Greek alphabet  alpha, beta, gamma, delta and so forth, and Alpha Centauri" means the brightest star in the constellation of Centaurus, located high in the southern skies. You need to be south of the equator to see it well. 
R 19  Estimating the  Distance to 	  the Moon 
Chapter  Outline 	  Aristarchus around 270 BC derived the Moons distance from the duration of a lunar eclipse (Hipparchus later found an independent method). It was commonly accepted in those days that the Earth was a sphere (although its size was only calculated a few years later, by Eratosthenes (See the chapter The Round Earth and Columbus" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL Astronomers also believed that the Earth was the center of the universe, and that Sun, Moon, planets and stars all orbited around it. It was only natural, then, that Aristarchus assumed that the Moon moved in a large circle around Earth. Let R be the radius of that circle and T the time it takes the Moon to go around once, about one month. In that time the Moon covers a distance of 2?R, where ?? 3.1415926... (pronounced pi") is a mathematical constant, the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter. An eclipse of the Moon occurs when the Moon passes through the shadow of the Earth, on the opposite side from the Sun (therefore, it must be a full Moon). If r is the radius of the Earth, the shadows width is close to the Earths diameter, or2r. Let t be the time it takes the mid-point of the Moon to cross the center of the shadow, about 3 hours (in eclipses of the longest duration, when the Moon crosses the center of the shadow). If the moon moves around the Earth at a constant speed  and it takes time T (again, about a month) to cover 2?R ? 6.28R, its speed can be expressed as the ratio of distance traveled to the time it takes as 
Vm =  	  Since it takes the moon about 3 hours to travel a distance of 2r, we can also express its speed as: Vm = Setting these equal to each other, we find: 
 	  = t t 
 	  ? 60 r This result fits the average distance of the Moon accepted today, 60 Earth radii. The word about" was used here more than once. For instance, the orbital period of the Moon was stated to be about" one month. In fact, the length of the lunar month" from one new Moon to the next (or from one full Moon to the next) is 29.53 days, but the Moons orbital period is actually 2.21 days shorter (this is discussed in the section on the calendar (See the chapter The Calendar" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL Viewed from Earth, a new Moon" (occurring between the time a thin crescent is last seen before sunrise and the time one is seen shortly after sunset) happens when the Moon in its apparent motion around the sky overtakes the Sun. However, by the time of the next new Moon, the Suns position in the sky has already shifted. If the Sun takes 12 months to go around the sky (or around the ecliptic, or around the zodiac), then in one month it completes 1/12 of its circuit. The Moon must therefore complete [1+(1/12)] circuits to catch up with the Sun again, and the lunar month (synodic period") is about 1/12 of a month longer than the actual period of 27.32 days. Also, the Earths shadow has only approximately the width of 2r. It would have very nearly a width of 2r if the Sun were a point-like light source ( exactly that width if it were infinitely far away). Actually, however, the Sun is large enough to appear as a disk which covers about half a degree of the sky. As a result, the Earths shadow is not a cylinder but a gradually narrowing cone, and at the Moons distance it is already about 25% narrower than 2r. Here is another way of looking at the same process. Suppose we observe the eclipse from the Moon. Seen from there, the Earth moves from east to west  from A to B in the drawing, assuming the eclipse is of greatest length (i.e. the middle of the Earth passes in front of the Sun). Earth blocking the Sun during a lunar eclipse (not to scale). The eclipse begins when the last bit of the western edge of the Sun passes point A (right of the drawing shown) and ends when the first bit of the eastern edge of the Sun pokes out at point B. That takes less time than it takes for the center of the Sun to pass from A to B (left drawing) which would be the duration of the eclipse if the Sun were a tiny point source, located at its middle. 
Chapter  Outline 	  Hipparchus, who used an eclipse of the Moon to deduce the precession of the equinoxes (See the chapter Precession" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL used a total eclipse of the Sun  probably in 129 BCto estimate how far the Moon was. That distance had also been derived from a lunar eclipse by Aristachussee the chapter Estimating the Distance to the Moon" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL That eclipse was total at the Hellespont  the Dardanelles, part of the narrow strait that separates the European and Asian parts of Turkey  but only 4/5 of the Sun were covered in Alexandria of Egypt, further to the south. Hipparchus knew that when the Sun was eclipsed, it and the Moon occupied the same spot on the sphere of the heavens. The reason, he assumed, was that the Moon passed between us and the Sun. He believed that the Sun was much more distant than the Moon, as Aristarchus of Samos had concluded, about a century earlier, from observing the time when the Moon was exactly half full (see chapters Estimating the Distance to the Moon" and Does the Earth Revolve Around the Sun" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL He also assumed that the peak of the eclipse occurred at the same time at both locations (not assured, but luckily not too far off), and he then carried out the following calculation. Moon blocking the Sun during a solar eclipse (not to scale). In a total eclipse of the Sun, the Moon just barely covers the Sun. The Sun itself is so distant that when viewed from anywhere on Earth, it covers practically the same patch of the sky, with a width of about 0.5 degrees. Hipparchus concentrated on point E at the edge of the Moon (drawing), which during totality, when viewed from the Hellespont (point B) just overlapped point D on the edge of the Sun. Viewed from Alexandria (point A), at that same moment, the point E only overlapped point C on the Sun, about 1/5 solar diameter short of the edge  which was why the eclipse there was not total. One-fifth of the Suns diameter covers about 0.1 degrees in the sky, so the small angle ? (alpha, Greek A) between the two directions measured about 0.1 degrees. That angle is the parallax (See the chapter Parallax" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL of the edge of the Moon, viewed from the above two locations. It is unlikely that Hipparchus knew the distance AB, but he probably knew the latitudes of the Hellespont and Alexandria. The local latitude can be shown to be equal to the elevation of the celestial pole above the horizon and today can be readily deduced by observing the height of Polaris, the pole star above the horizon. In the time of Hipparchus the pole of the heavens wasnt near Polaris (because of the precession of the equinoxes), but Hipparchus, who had mapped the positions of about 850 stars, must have known its position quite well. The latitude of the Hellespont (from a modern atlas) is about 40?200 (40 degrees and 20 minutes, 60 minutes per degree), while that of Alexandria is about 31?200, a difference of 9 degrees. We will also assume Alexandria is exactly due south. If furthermore r is the radius of the Earth, then the circumference of the Earth is 2?r. Since the circumference also spans 360 degrees, we get The points AB are also located on another circle, centered on the Moon. The radius in that case is the distance R to the Moon, and because the arc AB covers 0.1 degrees, we get 
 	  Strictly speaking, each of the two arcs AB expressed in the above equations is measured along a different circle, with a different radius (and the two circles curve in opposite ways). However, in both cases AB covers only a small part of the circle, so that as an approximation we may regard each of the arcs as equal to the straight-line distance AB. That assumption allows us to regard the two expressions as equal and to write 
 	  r suggesting the Moons distance is 90 Earth radii, an overestimate of about 50 per cent. One reason an excessive value was obtained is that the Moon was assumed to be overhead at A or B. Actually, it is likely to be at some significant angle to the overhead direction, the zenith" (see drawing). Then the section cut by the angle ? from the circle of radius R around E is not AB but AF (second drawing), which is smaller. Taking this into account reduces the distance. We dont know where the Sun was during the 129 BC eclipse, but it must have been on the ecliptic (the words are obviously related!), which places it within 23.5? of the celestial equator, on either side. Assuming it was on the equator (that is, it passed overhead on the Earths equator) and south of the reported observations (i.e. the eclipse occurred near noon) one can make a crude estimate of the correction, using simple trigonometry (see URL The Hellespont is around latitude of 40 degrees, and as the drawing shows, that is also the angle between the Moons direction and the zenith. From the drawing: 
F =  Bcos40? = 0.766 	  Repeating the preceding calculation for AF: 
 	  And in the end, 
 	  = 900.766 = 69 r According to A History of Astronomy" by A. Pannekoek, the result obtained by Hipparchus was between 62 and 73 Earth radii. Today we know the average distance is about 60 radii, varying by a few Earth radii either way because of the ellipticity of the Moons orbit. In the absence of accurate timing, the method is almost guaranteed to produce an overestimate. The Earth rotates beneath the shadow spot cast by the Moon, which makes that spot sweep over a long strip, hitting many different locations at different times. The Hellespont was just one of many places where the eclipse was total. Similarly, Alexandria was just one of many locations where 4/5 of the Sun was covered. Randomly selecting point B from the first group and point A from the second may give a much longer baseline AB and a much larger (and incorrect) distance of the Moon. The fact Alexandria is almost exactly south of the Hellespont does not guarantee their peak eclipse times are the same, just that they are not too different. 
Does the  Earth  Revolve  Around the  Sun 	  Aristarchus of Samos, an early Greek astronomer (about 310 to 230 BC), was the first to suggest that the Earth revolved around the Sun, rather than the other way around. He gave the first estimate of the distance of the Moon (See the chapter Estimating the Distance to the Moon" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL and it was his careful observation of a lunar eclipsepin-pointing the Suns position on the opposite side of the skythat enabled Hipparchus, 169 years later, to deduce the precession of the equinoxes (See the chapter Precession" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL Except for one calculation  an estimate of the distance and size of the Sun  no work of Aristarchus has survived. However, one could guess why he believed that the Sun, not the Earth, was the central body around which the other one revolved. His calculation suggested that the Sun was much bigger than the Earth  a watermelon, compared to a peach  and it seemed unlikely that the larger body would orbit one so much smaller. Here we will develop a line of reasoning somewhat like the one Aristarchus used (for his actual calculation, see reference at the end). Aristarchus started from an observation of a lunar eclipse (See the chapter Estimating the Distance to the Moon" in the From Stargazers to Starships FlexBook resource on URL At such a time the Moon moves through the Earths shadow, and what Aristarchus saw convinced him that the shadow was about twice as wide as the Moon. Suppose the width of the shadow was also the width of the Earth (actually it is less  see below, also here). Then the diameter of the Moon would be half the Earths. Aristarchus next tried to observe exactly when half the moon was sunlit. For this to happen, the angle Earth-MoonSun (6 EMS in the drawing here) must be exactly 90 degrees. Knowing the Suns motion across the sky, Aristarchus could also locate the point P in the sky, on the Moons orbit (near the ecliptic), which was exactly 90 degrees from the direction of the Sun as seen from Earth. If the Sun were Chapter 21.	Does the Earth Revolve Around the Sun very, very far away, the half-moon would also be on this line, at a position like M (drawn with a different distance scale, for clarity). Aristarchus estimated, however, that the direction to the half-Moon made a small angle a with the direction to P, about 1/30 of a right angle or 3 degrees. As the drawing shows, 6 EMS (Earth-Moon-Sun) then also must equal 3 degrees. If Rs is the Suns distance and Rm the Moons, a full 360 degree circle around the Sun at the Earths distance has a length of 2?Rs. The distance Rm = EM is then about as long as an arc of that circle covering 3 degrees, or 1/120 of the full circle. It follows that: 
Rm 	  Therefore, 
Rs 	  ? 19, Rm making the Sun  according to Aristarchus  19 times more distant than the Moon. Since the two have very nearly the same size in the sky  even though one of them is 19 times more distant, the Sun must also be 19 times larger in diameter than the Moon. If the Moons diameter is half the size of the Earths, the Sun must be 19/2 or nearly 10 times wider than the Earth. The effect described in the figures of the next section modifies this argument somewhat (URL If Aristarchus had observed correctly, that would make the Suns diameter 19/3 times  a bit more than 6 times  than the Earth. Actually, he had not! His method does not really work, because in actuality the position of the half-Moon is very close to the line OP. The angle ?, far from being 3 degrees, is actually so small that Aristarchus could never have measured it, especially without a telescope. The actual distance to the Sun is about 400 times that of the Moon, not 19 times, and the Suns diameter is similarly about 400 times the Moons and more than 100 times the Earths. But it makes no difference. The main conclusion, that the Sun is vastly bigger than Earth, still holds. Aristarchus could just as well have said that the angle ? was at most 3 degrees, in which case the Sun was at least 19 times more distant than the Moon, and its size at least 19/3 times that of Earth. In fact he did say so  but he also claimed it was less than 43/6 times larger than the Earth (Greeks used simple fractionsthey knew nothing about decimals), which was widely off the mark. But it makes no difference: as long as the Sun is much bigger than the Earth, it makes more sense that it, rather than the Earth, is at the center. Good logic, but few accepted it, not even Hipparchus and Ptolemy. In fact, the opposite argument was made: if the Earth orbited the Sun, it would be on opposite sides of the Sun every 6 months. If that distance was as big as Aristarchus claimed it to be, would not the positions of the stars differ when viewed from two spots so far apart? We now know the answer: the stars are so far from us, that even with the two points 20 times further apart than Aristarchus had claimed, the best telescopes can barely observe the shift of the stars. It took nearly 18 centuries before the ideas of Aristarchus were revived by Copernicus. 
The  Earths  Shadow 	  In a lunar eclipse, if the width of the shadow of the Earth is twice the width of the Moon, then the width of the Earth itself is (very nearly) three times that of the Moon  not twice, as one might perhaps think. Here is why: The Sun is not a point of light but an extended source, with a disk covering a circular patch in the sky, about 0.5 degrees across. This makes the shadow of the Earth not a cylinder, stretching to infinity without narrowing down, but a cone, with an angle of 0.5 degrees across its apex C (drawing). AB is here the diameter of the Earth, and the directions AC and BC represents rays from opposite edges of the Suns disk, rays whose directions differ by 0.5 degrees. If x is the diameter of the Moon and R its distance, then according to Aristarchus, the width ED of the shadow at distance Requals 2x (actually, 2.5x comes closer to the mark). We add to the drawing points H and K so that HA = KD = x. The width of the Moon as seen from point H is KD = x, and since the Moons size in the sky is about the same as the Suns, the angle KHD (shaded) should also equal 0.5 degrees. We now extend the line AD = R a further distance R to point F. Then the two shaded triangles HKD and KFD are congruent (= same in size and shape) and have the same 0.5 angle as the angle at C. Indeed, one can prove now that the triangles GFC and AHD are also congruent to the two shaded ones. It follows then that AC = 3R, and from simple proportions (see drawing) AB = 3x.
