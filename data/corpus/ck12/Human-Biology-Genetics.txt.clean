Chapter  Outline 	  What makes one species different from another? Look around your classroom and notice how much you and your classmates look alike. Each of you has a head, arms, legs, eyes, ears, a nose, hair, fingers, toes, and so on. Your classmates are all human beings. You could easily make a list of characteristics that most human beings have in common. Characteristics are distinctive qualities of living things. In this unit you will explore what determines different characteristics of living organisms and how characteristics are passed from generation to generation. To study living things, both plants and animals, we sort them into groups that have similar characteristics. Think about your pets, for example. All cats have similar characteristics. You are able to recognize a cat when you see one. You could make a list of the characteristics of cats that set cats apart from other animals. Even though cats and dogs both have two ears and a tail, you probably dont confuse a cat with a dog. Dogs have characteristics that make them different from cats. What are some of the characteristics that help distinguish cats from dogs? Plants also have characteristics that can be used to sort them into groups. You do not confuse oak trees and maple trees, even though both are trees. You can tell the difference between tulips and daffodils because they have different characteristics. "Like produces like" One characteristic of living things that belong to the same group is that they can reproduce to produce offspring that have characteristics similar to those of the parents. For example, when cats reproduce, they have kittens. Dogs produce puppies, and horses produce foals. And two human beings reproduce a human baby, not a puppy. The same phenomenon-like produces like-is true of plants, as well as animals. For example, a farmers corn seeds produce corn. An acorn that is planted by a forest ranger will grow into a new oak tree that will produce more acorns. If you plant marigold seeds in your garden you expect more marigolds. These marigolds will in turn produce more marigold seeds. A group of living things that has similar characteristics and can interbreed (reproduce among themselves) is called a species. The phenomenon of living things producing offspring with similar characteristics is continuity. Look at your classmates again. They are all the same species. You are all members of the species Homo sapiens. Now take another good look around at your classmates. Though you are all the same species, you are different from one another in many ways. Some classmates may have blond hair. Some have black hair. There are probably many shades of brown hair among your classmates, too. Some have straight hair, while others have hair that is wavy or curly. Some classmates are probably taller than others are. Some are male and others are female. Some have dark skin while others have fair skin. Some have noses that are long and thin, while others have short, turned-up noses. Just as you have no difficulty distinguishing human beings from other groups of living things, you have no difficulty distinguishing individual human beings from one another. Even if there is a set of identical twins in your class, you probably can tell them apart. It is possible to distinguish individuals belonging to the same species of all living organisms. If you have ever selected a new puppy from a litter, you know that each puppy is different, and you know that it is possible to tell the puppies apart. If you have chosen a pet parakeet from a cage with four or five parakeets, you knew which one you wanted-just any parakeet probably would not do. If you look carefully at a row of tulip plants, you will be able to describe each individual plant. Some have broader leaves than others do. Some have red petals, while others have petals that are pink. Eye Variation To measure eye width, you need to work with a partner. You need a ruler (metric) and a piece of string about 25 cm long. While one partner closes his or her eyes, the other partner measures the eye width from the outside corner of one eye across the bridge of the nose to the outside corner of the other eye. Mark the string by holding it with the thumb and forefinger of each hand at the outside corners of each eye. While holding the string, move it to the table. Line up the string along a ruler and measure the length of the string. This is the eye width. Record the measurements on a class chart. Now reverse roles with your partner. The difference among living organisms is called diversity. Diversity exists even among living organisms within the same species. 
Genetics 	  Genetics is the study of the biological causes of continuity and diversity among living things. Geneticists are scientists who study genetics. They study the biological causes for the similarities and differences between members of the same species. Remember that the word trait means a characteristic that all members of the same species have. Geneticists use the word variation when they mean the characteristics that make members of the same species different from one another. Variations are the different forms of a trait. For humans, having hair is a trait, but the many colors of hair are variations of that trait. Your set of variations makes you special. There is no one else in the world exactly like you. Even if you have a twin, there are differences between you and your twin. Geneticists are interested in the biological causes of continuity and diversity. They are concerned with traits and variations that are inherited. Inherited characteristics can be passed from parents to their offspring (from one generation to the next). For example, a geneticist would not study human hair length, since humans style their hair differently, which often includes cutting hair. Hair length is not inherited in humans. A geneticist might be interested in hair color, but would have to make sure the hair color was natural and not dyed. 
Introduction 	  What is your unique fingerprint pattern? One way to tell the difference between human beings is to look at their fingerprints. Even the fingerprints of identical twins are different. However, there are only 4 patterns of fingerprintsthe whorl, the loop, the arch, and the composite. One of these patterns is on each finger. If you examine all ten of your fingers, you might find all of the patterns, or you might find only one of the patterns. In this activity you determine the fingerprint pattern of each of your fingers. 
Magnifying glass 	  Ruler (metric) 
Procedure 	  Step 1 Look carefully at the four basic fingerprint patterns shown in Figure 1.3. Note the differences among the four patterns. In the whorl pattern, ridges circle around a point. In the loop pattern, ridges enter from one side, form a loop in the center, and exit from the same place. In the arch pattern, ridges flow across the finger with a rise in the center. In the composite pattern, there is a combination of two or more of the other three patterns. Step 2 Wash and dry your hands. Step 3 Have your partner press each of your fingers onto the pad. DO NOT ROLL YOUR FINGER. Step 4 Have your partner press each finger onto the appropriate section of the chart on your Activity Report. You might want to practice on a plain piece of paper first. Step 5 Wash your hands before you continue. Protect your fingerprints by covering them with clear tape. Step 6 Examine each of your fingerprints carefully. You may need the magnifying glass. Decide which of the four patterns is most like yours. Your fingerprints will not look exactly like the patterns in the figure, but should be close enough for you to decide. Step 7 Write the name of the pattern below each box on your Fingerprint Chart on the Activity Report. Step 8 Look at the fingerprints of other people in your group and notice how they are the same and how they are different. Step 9 Enter your prints on a class tally either on the board or on the overhead projector. 
Environment 	  The external environment plays an important role in shaping (influencing) variations in humans. Sometimes scientists argue which is more important in determining some variations-the genes or the environment. Scientists refer to this argument as the nature versus nurture argument-where nature refers to the genes and nurture to the environment. Both environment and genes play an important part in causing variations. Lets look at an example. The mothers body is the environment for the unborn child, so it is important that a woman takes especially good care of herself before and during her pregnancy. If a woman drinks alcohol when she is pregnant, her baby can be born with abnormal characteristics that are referred to as fetal alcohol syndrome. One of the abnormal characteristics is mental retardation. (a) What term refers to the phenomenon of living organisms producing offspring with similar characteristics? (b) What term refers to the phenomenon that all living organisms, even those from the same species, are different from each other? CHAPTER 2 Cells and Chromosomes Student Edition (Human Biology) 
Chapter  Outline 	  How does the individual develop certain characteristics? We can identify a species by a list of unique traits that are shared by all members of that species but not shared by members of other species. Variations of those same traits also can help us distinguish individuals within the species from one another. Anyone who studies genetics is interested in the biological causes of traits and variations. Geneticists ask questions such as, Why does Paul have blue eyes when his mother and father both have brown eyes? What color might the kittens be if a black cat and a gray cat reproduced? Notice that the first question requires an explanation. It is a question about something that has happened. The second question requires a prediction. It asks about something that may happen or is going to happen. Geneticists solve problems that help them explain and predict the inheritance of traits and variations. (Notice the last sentence had six words that were italicized. Those six, italicized words have special meaning to scientists. Make sure you know the meanings of all these words!) Most of modern genetics is nothing more than a search for variation. Some of the differences can be seen with the naked eye. Others need more sophisticated methods of molecular biology. -The Language of Genes, 
Steve  Jones 	  To solve problems that explain and predict traits and variations, you have to know some things about cells. All living organisms are composed of cells. Cells work like little factories doing all the jobs inside your body that are needed to keep your body functioning. Your body is made up of many different kinds of cells such as skin cells, muscle cells, and nerve cells. Some cells look like squashed bricks, some look like doughnuts, and many have irregular shapes. However, every cell, no matter what its job, has the same basic parts. All human cells have an outer border that is the boundary of the cell. This boundary is called the cell membrane. A liquid material called cytoplasm is inside the cell membrane. There is a large structure suspended in the cytoplasm called the nucleus. The nucleus is the part of a cell that contains the genetic information. The nucleus is surrounded by a nuclear membrane that, like the cell membrane, makes a boundary around the nucleus. With few exceptions, every cell in your body has a nucleus. Your mature red blood cells and the cells in the lenses of your eyes do not have nuclei. The cells that give rise to, or produce, your red blood cells and the cells in the lenses have nuclei. However, the mature cells do not.

Chapter  Outline 	  What is the composition of a chromosome? Karyotyping was not introduced until the 1950s. However, as early as the 1920s, scientists agreed that chromosomes were made of two chemical substancesdeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and protein. After these substances were identified, the next question was, Which of these two substances carries the genetic information? By 1952, results of several experiments led scientists to agree that DNA was the substance responsible for the inheritance of traits. In this section you will learn about DNA. If DNA is responsible for the inheritance of traits, then what is a gene? We hear that word, and we read that word often. For example, She is a good athlete, because its in her genes. A test showed he carries a gene for cystic fibrosis. Fourteen percent of African Americans carry the gene for sickle-cell anemia. A gene for pest resistance was inserted into a new variety of potatoes. A gene is a segment or a region of DNA that codes for a specific trait. What a gene really codes for, however, is a specific protein molecule, and protein molecules are the basis for traits. The questions you now have to ask are, How does the sequence of DNA code for a protein molecule, and how is the DNA code replicated from cell to cell and organism to organism, so they all have the ability to make specific proteins? Well answer the second question first. Well answer it by learning more about DNA. Its very important to keep in mind that a chromosome is a long DNA molecule, and that the individual segments of that molecule are genes. Each gene is a DNA code that carries information for duplicating itself and for producing a protein molecule. Did You Know? Rosalind Franklin was the first person to discover that DNA was in the form of a helix. She and another scientist named Maurice Wilkins used X-rays to investigate the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick later used the X-ray photographs to create their famous model of the DNA structure. Unfortunately, Rosalind Franklin did not share in the 1962 Nobel Prize with the other scientists because she died in 1958. The Nobel Prize is awarded only to living individuals. In 1953, James D. Watson and Francis H. C. Crick, based on information about DNA from several different scientists, constructed a model of a DNA that explained what was known about DNA at the time. The construction of the model of the DNA molecule is considered to be one of the most important events in the history of biology. It allowed scientists to ask even more questions about how genes cause traits and variations. Despite the fact that the construction of this model is so important to genetics, it is interesting to note that Watson and Crick made their first successful model using pieces of cardboard. Later they made a more permanent tin model. Since that time, models of DNA have been made of almost every material imaginable, from glass to gum drops. 
Introduction 	  Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a long molecule that contains the genetic information for gene expression and for the continuity between generations. It is one of the important molecules required for life. What does DNA look like? What are some of its many unique properties? In this activity you have the opportunity to precipitate and spool DNA onto a rod. The DNA has been isolated from the nuclei of cells. 
Procedure 	  Step 1 Obtain a test tube containing the 2 ml (milliliter) sample of DNA. Examine the solution of DNA. Describe its appearance, color, and viscosity. Step 2 Use tile eyedropper to add 4 or 5 drops of the salt solution to the test tube containing the DNA. Carefully hold the test tube in one hand and tap gently on the bottom of the tube to mix. Step 3 Pour 4 ml of alcohol into the test tube by slowly trickling the entire contents of ethyl alcohol down the side of the test tube containing the DNA and the NaCl. Step 4 Observe the interface between the two solutions. Do not mix the two layers. Step 5 Place the wooden skewer all the way to the bottom of the test tube that contains the two-layered solution. Step 6 Observe the interface as you rotate the skewer and wind (spool) the DNA that comes out of the solution onto the skewer. This is not a single DNA molecule, but thousands of molecules. If you have a partner, be sure to take turns spooling. Step 7 Examine and touch the DNA on the skewer. Record the appearance, color, and texture of the DNA. Step 8 When you are finished, ask your teacher what to do with your spooled DNA and supplies. What is so special about DNA? What does it do and how does it work? DNA does two important things. Proteins are responsible for cell structure and are the products of gene expression. Remember that DNA is part of the chromosomes and is located in the nucleus of the cell. The structure of a DNA molecule is simple to learn. A DNA molecule is made up of four different, complex chemical molecules, called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a sugar molecule called deoxyribose, a phosphate molecule, and one of four nitrogen molecules (adenine, guanine, cyostine, and thymine). (See Figure 3.2.) A phosphate, a sugar, and an adenine molecule make up the adenine nucleotide. A phosphate, a sugar, and a thymine molecule make up a thymine nucleotide. A phosphate, a sugar, and a guanine molecule make up the guanine nucleotide. A phosphate, a sugar, and a cytosine molecule make up a cytosine nucleotide. Nucleotides are joined together, one after the other, and form a helix chain. Two of these chains pair. When they pair, they then twist to form a double helix (Figure 3.3), which is a name that scientists use meaning two-chained coil or spring. The structure of DNA is like a twisted ladder. The sugar and phosphates make up the uprights of the ladder. The rungs are made up of pairs of complimentary nitrogen bases. These pairs fit together like a lock and key fit together. They consist either of adenine joined to thymine or cytosine joined to guanine. Because the four nucleotides of DNA can be arranged in any sequence along the strand of DNA, an unlimited number of different DNA molecules are possible. 
Introduction 	  What does DNA look like? Where is it found in the cell? How can DNA be removed from a cell so we can see it? In this activity you answer these questions by treating cells so you can remove DNA. You use thymus cells from an animal whose thymus cells are similar to human thymus cells. 
Alcohol 	  Cheesecloth square (several layers, 15x15 cm) 
Procedure 	  Step 1 Obtain supplies for your team and arrange them at your lab station. Step 2 Using forceps, place a sample of thymus tissue in the mortar (bowl). Add a pinch of sand and 1 to 2 dropperfuls of water. Use the pestle to grind the thymus well, adding a little more water as necessary to make a thick, soup like mixture. Answer question 1 on your Activity Report. Step 3 Put a test tube into a test tube rack and place a small funnel in the test tube. Spread a cheesecloth square over the large opening at the top of the funnel. Step 4 Carefully pour the thymus contents of your mortar in the cheesecloth square and allow the liquid to filter through the cheesecloth and funnel. Carefully draw together the edges of the cheesecloth and use tl1e forceps to help squeeze the remaining liquid from the thymus mixture. Now discard the cheesecloth and its contents into a special waste container as indicated by your teacher. Step 5 Take a drop-of the thymus cell liquid from the test tube. Place it on a microscope slide, and put a cover slip carefully on top of the drop. Observe the slide under a microscope. Then, on your Activity Report, draw what you see. Add labels, if possible. Answer question 2. Step 6 Add 3 to 4 drops of liquid soap to the liquid in your test tube. Carefully hold the test tube in one hand and gently tap on the bottom of the tube to mix. Answer question 3 on your Activity Report. Step 7 Mark the level of the liquid in the test tube with a permanent marker. Step 8 Tilt the test tube and slowly trickle an equal volume of alcohol down the inside of the test tube. Wait 30-60 seconds and carefully observe to see what happens at the interface (where the alcohol and thymus mixtures meet). Answer question 4 on your Activity Report. Step 9 Place a wooden skewer in the test tube and twirl it. Carefully observe what happens as you twirl the skewer. Keep twirling the skewer until there is no further change. Answer question 5 on your Activity Report. Step 10 Remove the skewer. Place the skewer on a paper towel and carefully blot it dry. Observe the DNA. What does it look like? How does it feel when you touch it? Record your observations on your Activity Report. Step 11 Using clean, dry forceps, carefully remove the DNA from the skewer. Place the DNA on a small piece of black construction paper. Use clear tape to cover your specimen to keep it from drying out and to fasten the specimen onto the construction paper. Attach the paper to your Activity Report in the space provided. Complete question 6 on your Activity Report. Step 12 Wash and dry all the glassware you used during the investigation. Store the materials appropriately. Step 13 Design an alternative procedure you could use to explore different ways of removing thymus DNA. One example might be using different soaps. Another procedure might be using different types of alcohol. Record your ideas on the Activity Report. Share your experimental design with your class. Answer question 7 on the Activity Report. Step 14 How would you modify your experimental design to use different sources for DNA? Which sources would you choose and why? Record your proposals on the Activity Report. Answer question 8. 
Replication 	  One of DNAs most important functions is to make a copy of itself. In making copies of itself, DNA can pass from one generation of cells to the next. When a strand of DNA makes an exact copy of itself, the process is called replication. Replication or duplication of DNA occurs just before a cell divides. Replication is very important to the study of genetics and how traits and variations are passed along from generation to generation. How does the strand split during replication? The DNA molecule comes apart where the adenine and thymine meet and where the guanine and cytosine meet. The DNA molecule acts like it is unzipping as it begins to replicate. As the DNA is unzipping, spare pieces of nucleotides that are found in the nucleus are matched to the free ends of adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. Thymine (T) bonds to adenine (A). Cytosine (C) bonds to guanine (G). Guanine (G) bonds to cytosine (C). Adenine (A) bonds to thymine (T). Two new molecules of DNA are formed that are identical to the original DNA molecule. Did You Know? All organisms have chromosomes that contain DNA. If all organisms contain DNA, what makes a tulip a tulip and not a dog? What makes a goldfish a goldfish and not a human? The DNA in various species differs in the number and arrangement of the four nucleotides-adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. In fact, every organism has a unique sequence (order) of nucleotides making up the DNA. 
Introduction 	  How do nucleotides fit together to make a DNA molecule? What does this double helix molecule look like? In this activity you make a model of DNA. Then you make a copy of your model to learn more about the structure and function of DNA and how it replicates. 
T  A- A  A  	  Step 1 Working in pairs, cut out pieces from the template for each of the following. 
D-deoxyribose (sugar), white 	  Your task is to make a total of 60 nucleotides: Make an adenine nucleotide by taping together 1 adenine nitrogen base, 1 deoxyribose sugar, and 1 phosphate. Make 14 more adenine nucleotides. Make 15 cytosine nucleotides. Each cytosine nucleotide is made of 1 cytosine, 1 deoxyribose sugar, and 1 phosphate. Tape the 3 parts of each cytosine nucleotide together. Make 15 thymine nucleotides. Each thymine nucleotide is made of 1 thymine, 1 deoxyribose sugar, and 1 phosphate. Tape the 3 parts of each thymine nucleotide together. Make 15 guanine nucleotides. Each guanine nucleotide is made of 1 guanine, 1 deoxyribose sugar, and 1 phosphate. Tape the 3 parts of each guanine nucleotide together. Step 2 Build a ladder consisting of 12 nucleotide pairs. Do not use more than 7 individual adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine nucleotides that you made. Tape the nucleotides together. Remember that adenine pairs with thymine and cytosine pairs with guanine. Save the remaining nucleotides for Part B of this activity. Step 3 Hold both ends of the model and gently twist. You have made a double helix. Step 4 Answer questions 1 through 5 on the Activity Report. 
T  B- 	  Step 5 Gently untwist your DNA model from Part A and place it in front of you. Separate the 2 halves of your model by cutting between the nitrogen bases (A T and C G). Step 6 Using the extra nucleotides you saved from Part A, add nucleotides to each of the DNA halves. Remember that adenine bonds (connects) with thymine, and cytosine bonds with guanine. Answer questions 6 and 7 on the Activity Report. 
Chapter  Outline 	  Cell Division Student Edition (Human Biology) How are traits passed from one generation to the next generation? Remember that one of DNAs most important jobs is to replicate-make a copy of itself. In making copies of itself, DNA can pass from one generation of a family to the next. Genetics is the study of variations that are passed from one generation of a species to another. Before we study why certain variations are passed along in a species, you need to learn how genes are passed along during the reproductive process. Like sentences make up a paragraph, genes make up chromosomes. Every cell in the human body has a complete set of 46 chromosomes, on which an estimated 100,000 genes are located. Genes are responsible for an individual having the traits he or she has. For example, every human being has a gene for blood type that is located on Chromosome 9. When your body grows by making new cells, and when your body makes new cells to repair an injury, all of the new cells must have 46 chromosomes-your 46 chromosomes specific to you. Every cell has a complete set of chromosomes and genes. When cells divide, the chromosomes also must divide in a very regular way during a process called mitosis. Mitosis is the process in which the cell divides, producing two new cells, each with the same number and exact type of chromosomes as the parent cell. Geneticists know that the traits and variations passed from one generation of a family to another are contained in the chromosomes. They also know that 46 chromosomes must be passed from human parents to their children, so that each new generation has a complete set of chromosomes and genes. Why is this important? It is important because genes possess instructions for traits that make us human-instructions for building a person. If instructions are lost, the person may not develop properly. Each pair of chromosomes of an offspring consists of one chromosome from the mother and one chromosome from the father. This happens because gamete cells first go through a different division process called meiosis. Meiosis happens before fertilization occurs. 
Mitosis 	  As you learned, mitosis is the process in which the cell divides, producing two new cells. Each of the new cells has the same number and exact type of chromosomes as the parent cell had. Cell division provides for growth or replacement of worn-out cells throughout your body. In mitosis the set of chromosomes divides into two identical sets. Then one cell nucleus becomes two cell nuclei, each containing an identical set of chromosomes. When the cell divides into two, one set of chromosomes goes to each daughter cell so that each new daughter cell has an identical set of chromosomes. 
Introduction 	  Many-celled organisms, including you, begin as a single cell. What is the process of producing millions of cells from a single cell? In this activity you explore how a cell reproduces (divides) to form two new cells. Mitosis is a continuous and orderly process that occurs in your bodys somatic cells. In this activity you model each stage of mitosis using pipe cleaners to represent chromosomes. 
Activity  Report 	  Colored crayons or colored pens or pencils (same colors as pipe cleaners if possible) 
Procedure 	  Step 1 Gather four pairs of pipe cleaners to represent the chromosomes. Remember that your somatic cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes. In this activity we follow two pairs of chromosomes through the process of mitosis. Step 2 Arrange your pipe cleaners so each pipe cleaner in the pair is of the same length and color. Twist each pair together by one turn at the midpoint. Each pair of pipe cleaners represents a duplicated chromosome. The two different colors indicate that one chromosome came from the father and one chromosome came from the mother. Duplicate chromosomes are formed through the process of DNA replication, which occurs before mitosis begins. Step 3 Take two plates and place one plate on top of the other. The plates represent a cell. Put your chromosomes on the top plate. Using the crayons, draw a picture of the chromosomes on your Activity Report. This phase (prophase) can be recognized when the double chromosomes are visible and can be observed under the microscope as distinct bodies. Step 4 Line up the double chromosomes along a line that divides the top plate into two halves. Using crayons or colored pencils, draw a picture of the chromosomes on your Activity Report. During this phase (metaphase), the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell. Step 5 Now separate each double chromosome by untwisting them. Leave them side by side on the midline that runs through the center of the plate. Next, move one single, chromosome of each pair to the left of the plate and one to the right. Each chromosome is now a single chromosome, and each side of the plate should have two long and two Short, single chromosomes. This phase of mitosis (anaphase) occurs when double chromosomes separate into two single chromosomes that move to opposite sides of the cell. Step 6 Now it is time for the cell to divide into two daughter cells. You represent this step by bringing out the second plate and moving one set of single chromosomes to it. Each newly formed daughter cell has an identical set of chromosomes-two short and two long chromosomes. In this phase of mitosis (telophase), the cytoplasm divides, resulting in two daughter cells. Each newly formed daughter cell has a nucleus containing a complete set of chromosomes-two copies of the 23 different chromosomes found in the cell. On your Activity Report, record a colored drawing of the chromosomes placed on each plate. Step 7 In the next phase (interphase), the chromosomes lose their compact appearance. The chromosomes replicate their DNA so that each single chromosome becomes a duplicated chromosome as you did in Step 2 of the activity. Step 8 Discuss with your partner the questions on the Activity Report. Then record your responses. 
Meiosis 	  In animals, meiosis produces gamete cells. The gamete cells are the cells that are used to reproduce. Meiosis is more complex than mitosis. In meiosis, the chromosomes make copies of themselves as they did in mitosis, but the original cell divides two times. For every cell that begins the process, four new cells are produced. However, the chromosomes have replicated themselves only once. So the four new cells each have half the number of chromosomes of the species. The process of meiosis guarantees that each of these four cells receives one chromosome from each pair of chromosomes. That means that each of these cells has all of the chromosomes and genes that are typical for the species. But each cell has only one copy of each of the chromosomes and genes instead of the two copies that are in all of the other cells of the body. These special cells with half the number of chromosomes are called gamete cells. Gamete cells in males are called sperm. Gamete cells in females are called ova (eggs). All four cells produced by meiosis in males become sperm. In females, although four cells are produced, only one becomes an ovum (singular form of ova, or one egg). Human gamete cells produced by meiosis have 23 chromosomes. The event of an egg cell or ovum combining with a sperm cell is fertilization. In humans when an ovum and sperm join, each cell contributes 23 chromosomes. So the fertilized egg has the normal number of 46 chromosomes-half come from the mother and half come from the father. The fertilized egg is a zygote. The zygote goes through round after round of mitosis to produce a fetus, and eventually a baby. Through meiosis, chromosomes are sorted in a way that separates each pair of chromosomes. Through fertilization, they are recombined into new pairs. This is important for two reasons. First, the number of chromosomes per body cell (46) remains the same from one generation to the next (genetic continuity). Second, because each individual has his or her own unique set of chromosomes, there is greater human variety. 
Introduction 	  What is meiosis? Why is it important? How is it different from mitosis? In this activity you explore how chromosomes sort and recombine through meiosis and fertilization. Meiosis occurs only in the reproductive organs to produce gametes (sperm or eggs). 
Activity  Report 	  Crayons or colored pens or pencils (same colors as pipe cleaners if possible) 
Meiosis 	  Step 1 Work in pairs. In this part of the activity, you model what happens during meiosis. You should work on a flat surface. Remember that you have 23 pairs of chromosomes in each of your somatic cells. In this activity meiosis is simulated using only two pairs of chromosomes. Gather four pairs of pipe cleaners to represent two pairs of double chromosomes. Each chromosome pair is unique. Each contains genes for the same traits. The two pairs of double chromosomes are different from each other in both size and the genetic traits they contain. Step 2 Stack four plates on top of each other. Place your four double chromosomes in pairs on the top plate. The chromosomes are not organized in any particular way. The plate represents the parent cell. Record a colored drawing of the chromosomes on the plate on Data Sheet 1. Step 3 Now line up the pairs of double chromosomes along a line that divides the plate into two halves. Unlike mitosis, the chromosomes do not line up in a single row. The chromosomes line up in pairs. On Data Sheet 1, record a colored drawing of the chromosomes on the plate. Step 4 Place one member of each chromosome pair on the left side of the plate. Place the other member of each chromosome pair on the right side of the plate. Each side of the plate should have one long double chromosome and one Short double chromosome. On Data Sheet 1, record a colored drawing of the chromosomes on the plate. Step 5 Division 1: Now it is time for the cell to divide for the first time to produce two cells. Carefully separate the stack of four plates so that you have two stacks of two plates each. This is illustrated on Data Sheet 1. Transfer one set of double chromosomes to the other stack of plates. You should have two double chromosomes, each a different size on the top plate of each stack. On Data Sheet 1, record a colored drawing of the chromosomes on the plate. Step 6 On the top plate of each stack, separate each double chromosome by untwisting the strands. Leave them side by side on the midline through the center of the plate. Next, move one single chromosome of each pair to the left side of the plate and one to the right side of the plate. Each side of the plate should have one long and one short single chromosome. On Data Sheet 1, record a colored drawing of the chromosomes on the plate. Step 7 Division 2: Now it is time for the cell to divide again. Position the two stacks so they are about a foot apart. Separate the two plates of each stack so that the two plates of each stack are side by side. This is illustrated on Data Sheet 1. Transfer a set of single chromosomes (one of each kind of chromosome-one short chromosome and one long chromosome) onto the empty plates so that each of the four plates has two single chromosomes. These plates represent the four daughter gamete cells. Each newly formed daughter cell contains two single chromosomes. On Data Sheet 1, record a colored drawing of the chromosomes on the plate. Step 8 Discuss with your partner questions 1 and 2 on the Activity Report. Then record your responses to each question. 
Fertilization 	  Step 9 In this part of the activity you model what happens to the chromosomes during fertilization. Work together with another pair of students in the class. Select one of your plates and place it in front of you. Have the other team place one of their plates in front of them. Each plate should have two single chromosomes. The chromosomes on the two plates should be different colors. On Data Sheet 2, record a colored drawing of the chromosomes on the plate. Step 10 One of the plates represents a sperm cell and the other plate represents an egg cell (ovum). Move the plate representing the sperm cell next to the plate representing the egg cell. Transfer the chromosomes from the plate representing the sperm cell onto the plate representing the egg cell. (Now, there should be four single chromosomes on one of the plates and none on the other.) This process of the union of sperm and egg is called fertilization. The cell with the chromosomes is now called the fertilized egg or zygote. On Data Sheet 2, record a colored drawing of the chromosomes on the plate. Step 11 Discuss with your group questions 3 through 7 on the Activity Report. Then record your responses. You have learned that the genes are segments or regions of DNA and that DNA makes up chromosomes. DNAs job is to preserve a code for cells that tells the cells what to do. Interestingly, genetic codes for different genes can vary a lot. Some are short and others are long. Some have a lot of extra information in them and others do not. Sometimes, this information gets mixed up in the process of replication-resulting in a mutation. A mutation is an error in the order of one or more nucleotides of DNA. These errors can result in well-known diseases, such as those described in Section 7. 
 	  Codes for Proteins Student Edition (Human Biology) 
Chapter  Outline 	  How is information contained in DNA expressed? DNA has two jobs-one is to replicate and the other is to provide information for making proteins. The process of making proteins is called protein synthesis. Protein synthesis is the result of gene expression. And the synthesis of different proteins is what makes us humans. Proteins are the most complex and diverse of all molecules that make up the human body. Over half of the dry weight of the human body is protein. Protein molecules are very big. Small protein molecules have over 1,000 atoms, while large protein molecules may have over a million atoms. These atoms are organized into molecules called amino acids. The amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. A protein can consist of several hundred amino acids. Each species has its own set of proteins. Different cells in your body produce different proteins but have the same DNA. Proteins do many things in your body. Your muscles are made up of proteins that can contract. Your blood has the protein hemoglobin that carries oxygen to your cells. Your blood has other proteins that cause it to clot. Still other proteins protect you from germs. Proteins, called enzymes, control practically all of the chemical reactions in your cells. The cartilage that forms your joints and gives shape to your ears and nose is a protein. Proteins can do so many different things because they have very different shapes. The specific sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its shape. If a protein loses its shape, it loses its function. When you cook foods, you denature the proteins that are in the plant or animal tissues in the food. Scientists say protein is denatured when it loses its shape. In other units, you will learn about important protein molecules including hormones, hemoglobin, antibodies, and enzymes. Proteins are very important components of your body and of the bodies of all living things. Did You Know? Paleontologists study the DNA codes of ancient people they discover. Using this information, they can determine the group to which a person belonged. They also can determine when and where the people lived. This information tells us a lot about ancient civilizations, their movements, their longevity, and much more. The discovery of DNA added a new dimension to the study of paleontology and archaeology. 
A look at the  Information  Code 	  How does a DNA molecule, with only four nucleotides, contain the code for all the different proteins that are found in the human body? Remember that proteins are made of individual chemical building blocks called amino acids. There are more than 20 different amino acids. Many people have compared amino acids to letters in the alphabet. Just as we put together the letters in the alphabet into different combinations and sequences to make words, the amino acids are put together in different combinations to make different proteins. The DNA molecule contains coded information that controls the order in which the amino acids are put together. The code in DNA is a three-letter code. How can we read the DNA code? Each sequence of three nucleotides codes for an amino acid. For example, the DNA nucleotide sequence of thymine, cytosine, and adenine (TCA) is a code for the amino acid named serine. Cytosine-adenine-thymine (CAT) is a code for the amino acid named valine. The three nucleotides (triplet) on the DNA molecule that code for an amino acid act as a single unit. Genes vary in their length. Some are about 500 DNA-code letters long; others are more than 2,000,000 letters long! Did You Know? The sequence of nucleotides in DNA spells out code words for assembling amino acids to build proteins. These code words can be grouped together like a sentence or a message called a gene. The gene tells the cell to use specific amino acids in a specific order to make a particular protein, like hemoglobin. 
Putting the  Code to  Work to  Make  Protein 	  DNA is found only in the nucleus, but proteins are produced in the cytoplasm outside the nucleus. So the coded information of DNA must get from the nucleus to the cytoplasm somehow. How is this code of the DNA molecule read to make a protein? Three other molecules are involved in the process for DNA to transmit the code. The three chemicals involved are mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes. RNA is a molecule very much like DNA. It is composed of nucleotides that form base pairs with DNA, but it is a Single-stranded molecule rather than a double-stranded helix. Some RNA is in the form of a long chain and travels between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This RNA called mRNA carries the coded message from the DNA in the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The m stands for messenger. mRNA is the messenger that takes the DNA code to the cytoplasm where proteins are made. There are short pieces of RNA in the cytoplasm that carry or transfer a specific amino acid from the cytoplasm to sites where the proteins are assembled. These sites are called ribosomes. Amino acids are joined together to make a protein at the ribosomes. The amino acids are carried (or transferred) to the ribosomes where protein is assembled by RNA called tRNA. The t stands for transfer. Both mRNA and tRNA are made in the nucleus. Since there are 20 or more amino acids that are used to make proteins, there are more than 20 different tRNAs. You could think of protein synthesis like a construction project. The ribosomes are the construction sites where the protein is made. The DNA is the architect that has the design for a specific protein. The mRNA is the general contractor. The tRNAs are the various suppliers that bring the raw materials to the construction site, or in this case provide the amino acids for making the protein. The mRNA and the tRNAs meet at the ribosome. The mRNA has the coded message from the DNA, and the tRNAs have the different amino acids. When an mRNA and a tRNA that matches a particular triplet code on the mRNA meet at the ribosome, an amino acid is joined to the growing protein. 
Introduction 	  Where and how are proteins made in your cells? What is the role of DNA? What is the role of RNA? What is the role of the ribosomes? In this activity you write a script and role-play an important cell process to demonstrate the role of DNA in making RNA and the role of RNA in making proteins in your cells.

Recessive -  Student  Edition ( Human 	  Biology) 
Chapter  Outline 	  Why are offspring from the same parents different? How can offspring show traits not seen in either of their parents? You have learned that each person has two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from his or her mother and one from his or her father. The chromosomes are made of DNA, and they contain the genes that determine the traits of the individual. So if two sisters each receive half of their chromosomes (with genes) from their father and half from their mother, why are they different? For example, how can one sister have red hair and one sister have brown hair, especially when neither parent has red hair? The answers to these questions are found in the study of classical, or Mendelian, genetics. The word classical refers to the fact that these questions were answered before scientists knew anything about chromosomes, genes, or DNA. The word Mendelian refers to the scientist who first answered these questions a long time ago. You will learn about his famous experiments in this section. Every family, aristocratic or not, inherits in their genes a record of who their ancestors were and where they came from. -The Language of Genes 
Steve  Jones 	  Long before there was a science of genetics, people did controlled crosses, or breedings, of domesticated plants and animals. It was obvious that specific traits of individual plants or animals could be described, and these traits could be inherited by the offspring of those individual plants or animals. Sometimes a trait of one parent would be expressed in all of its offspring whether or not its mate shared the same trait. Sometimes the traits of the offspring were intermediate between those of the parents, and sometimes the trait of a parent did not show up in its offspring, but reappeared in its grandchildren. All of this underlying information was the special knowledge of plant and animal breeders until the rules underlying the inheritance of traits were discovered by an Austrian monk, Gregor Mendel, in the middle of the 1800s. This was the beginning of the science of genetics. Gregor Mendel discovered that traits are passed from parents to offspring as particles of inheritance (factors) that we now call genes. For each trait, the offspring inherited one particle from each parent. Some particles of inheritance appeared to be dominant in that they were likely to be expressed in the offspring if they were expressed in either parent. Other particles appeared to be recessive in that they were unlikely to be seen in the offspring if the other parent expressed the dominant trait. For example, if two human parents have blue eyes, their children will have blue eyes. However, if one parent comes from a family line that has always had brown eyes, all of the children will have brown eyes, even though one parent has blue eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant trait. However, sometimes two parents with brown eyes can have a child with blue eyes. Gregor Mendel described rules of particulate inheritance that explain how these patterns of inheritance of traits or heredity occur. 
The  Chromosome  Theory of  Heredity 	  Gregor Mendel did not know what a gene was. He did not even know what a chromosome was. He did not know about mitosis and meiosis, either. Right now, you know much more about these things than Gregor Mendel ever did. Mendel guessed that there were things like genes. He then did experiments in which he showed how these particles of inheritance passed from generation to generation. He found out that he could explain the results of his experiments by assuming that each individual inherits two particles (a pair of genes) for each trait, but before reproducing, the individual produced gamete cells that only contained one gene from each pair of genes. This is the process we know of as meiosis. As a result of meiosis, the offspring receives one gene of each of its pairs of genes from its mother and one from its father. However, the gene it receives from its mother could have come through its mother either from its grandmother or its grandfather. The gene it receives from its father could have come from the fathers mother or father. This is true for each gene. Thus each offspring receives a unique set of genes. This is why the offspring of the same two parents can be quite different. The genes remain unchanged from generation to generation, but they appear in different combinations. Mendels rules showed how to calculate the probabilities that traits would appear in offspring. TABLE 7.1: 
Observations of chromosome behavior 	  Many years after Mendel, scientists discovered chromosomes and how chromosomes behave in mitosis and meiosis. It was clear that the behavior of chromosomes was very similar to Mendels hypothesis for how genes had to behave to explain the inheritance of traits. This similarity was strong evidence that genes were found on chromosomes, even though no one had ever seen a gene. Figure 6.1 compares the hypotheses of gene behavior based on Mendels observations with the observations about how chromosomes behave. 
Pedigrees:  Tracing  Heredity 	  To understand genetics, it is necessary to do what Mendel did, that is to trace the inheritance of traits through generations. A pedigree is one of the tools that geneticists use to study and trace how traits and variations are passed from parents to offspring in a family. A pedigree is a family tree that shows relationships among members of a family. Animal breeders keep pedigrees to trace the characteristics of the animals with which they work. You may have seen a pedigree for a cat, dog, or horse, or you may have seen your own family tree. It is useful for geneticists to create a pedigree for a particular trait. We learned that traits have variations. That means that traits are determined by genes that have slight differences. Different forms of a gene are called alleles. A gene pair is made up of a pair of alleles. There are rules to follow when constructing a pedigree. These rules make it easier for geneticists to understand the pedigrees constructed by other geneticists. Figure 6.2 shows standard symbols used in constructing pedigrees. Members of the same generation are all on the same level. Older generations are on higher levels and younger generations are on lower levels. When placing the offspring of a couple on the pedigree, the oldest offspring is drawn first beginning on the left. Specific alleles can be indicated by shading or coloring the individual symbols. Pedigrees can help you learn how a trait is inherited. They can help you learn if an allele is a dominant one or recessive one. With this kind of information about a trait, you can predict the probability that it will be expressed in the offspring of a crossing of two individuals. This ability to predict is very important for plant and animal breeders. It is also important for genetic counselors who advise potential parents about the chances their offspring could have a particular genetic disease. In the activity that follows, you look at a pedigree to determine if a particular allele is dominant, and to figure out the rules of inheritance of this trait. Study the pedigree of the family closely and see what you can learn. Assume this is your family. The arrow points to you. a. Are you male or female? b. How many brothers do you have? c. How many uncles do you have? d. How many females have red hair? e. Is red hair due to a dominant or recessive allele? It is possible to construct pedigrees or family trees like the one above for many different traits. Such pedigrees help to sort out which traits of humans are determined by dominant alleles and which are controlled by recessive alleles. Figure 6.4 lists many traits that are known to be dominant and many related alleles that are recessive. The construction of pedigrees is a valuable tool for animal and plant breeders. It enables them to keep track of desirable and undesirable traits, determine if they are dominant or recessive, and predict what crosses will favor their expression and which crosses will minimize their expression.

The  Genetics of  Coat  Color in  Labrador  Retrievers 	  Imagine that you have a kennel and breed Labrador retrievers. You have bred black Labrador retrievers for years and all of your puppies have always been black. Suppose you have a friend who breeds chocolate Labrador retrievers and her puppies have always been chocolate. The two of you decide to cross your best dogs. The litter of your black female crossed with her chocolate male includes four black males and three black females. The litter of your friends chocolate female crossed with your black male includes three black males and five black females. Draw the pedigrees for these two crosses. What can you conclude about the dominance of coat-color alleles in Labrador retrievers? Lets figure out the patterns of inheritance of these alleles. First, you need to know a few more terms and tools that are used by geneticists. For any cross, the parents are designated as the P generation. Their offspring are designated as the F1 generation. Alleles are labeled with letters. A capital letter means the allele is dominant. A lowercase letter means the allele is recessive. The genetic makeup of an individual is its genotype. The genotype is represented by two letters for each trait, indicating two alleles. Gamete cells are labeled with only one letter because they carry only one allele for the trait. Now for the pedigrees you constructed for the two crossings of black and chocolate Labrador retrievers, you can write the animals coat-color genotype into each symbol. Starting with the parents, the black mother and black father would be BB. The chocolate mother and father would be bb. What would the genotypes of the sperm and ova of these dogs be? What would the genotypes of the puppies be? Remember that through meiosis, cells with two alleles for each trait produce gamete cells that have only one allele for each trait. Determine each of the following gamete cell genotypes. 
Genotype of gamete cells of the chocolate mother =	b 	  Genotype of gamete cells of the chocolate father = Genotype of gamete cells of the black mother = Genotype of gamete cells of the black father = Genotype of the puppies of the chocolate mother and the black father cross = Genotype of the puppies of the black mother and the chocolate father cross = Another way to represent the genetics of a particular cross is to use the allele letters and the symbol for male and female (male = , female = ). Then, arrange them in a table that allows you to write down all the possible combinations of the gamete cells of the mother and the father. The square, called a Punnett Square, in Figure 6.6 shows the outcome of a cross between the pure black male and the pure chocolate female. TABLE 7.3: 
 	  bb 
 	  b This table shows that the genotype of the mothers gamete cells could only be b and the genotype of the fathers gamete cells could be only B. Therefore, the genotypes of the puppies could be only Bb. Thus, each puppy would be black, but would carry a recessive allele for chocolate coat color. You and your friend like your new puppies so much that you decide to keep a few from each litter to breed when they grow up. You keep one male from your friends litter and one female from your litter to breed. These puppies are the F1 generation. When they grow up and you breed them to each other, they will create an F2 generation. Lets see if you can predict what coat colors you will get if you breed your F1 generation and produce F2 puppies. We can use the same type of table that is shown above to figure out this problem. First, we have to determine the possible genotypes of the gamete cells of each parent and then the genotypes of the resulting puppies. In each of the four boxes, combine the allele a puppy would receive from its mother and the one it would receive from its father. Each box will represent a possible genotype for a puppy resulting from this cross. How many will be black? How many will be chocolate? This set of boxes used to show the possible outcome of a cross is called a Punnett Square. It makes it easy to keep track of all possible combinations of alleles. Try two more crosses. Cross the F1 genotype with each of the P genotypes. How many black and how many chocolate puppies would you expect from each of these crosses? Your squares only leave room for the four possible genotypes, but what if each litter contained 8 puppies? How many chocolate and how many black puppies would you expect? If your breeding produce only 4 puppies, how many would you expect would be black and how many would you expect to be chocolate? What is the ratio of black to chocolate puppies? If you did two breedings of your F1 dogs and produced a total of 16 puppies, how many would you expect to be black and how many to be chocolate? 
Introduction 	  How is gene expression influenced by dominant and recessive alleles? In this activity you use red and white beans to represent dominant and recessive alleles to simulate allele combinations and gene expression. Then you observe the outcome of these different combinations by recording the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring. Materials 
Procedure 	  Step 1 Put 10 white beans and 10 red beans into each of 2 jars representing parents, and mix them up. Step 2 Without looking, pick a bean from each jar. Step 3 Record the color of each bean on your Activity Report. Step 4 Put the beans back into the same jars that they came from, mix the beans, and pick again. Step 5 Repeat Steps 2 through 4 fifteen times, replacing the beans every time. Step 6 On your Activity Report, fill in the gene pattern (genotype) column by writing down the allele-red bean = R (dominant) and white bean = r (recessive). For example, if you picked a red bean and a white bean, you would write Rr for the gene pattern. Step 7 Fill in the column for physical expression or phenotype. The physical expression or phenotype is what the offspring actually looks like. Use the following rules to fill in the column. RR is red in color. Rr is red in color. rR is red in color. rr is white in color. Step 8 Put 10 white beans and 10 red beans into one jar and 20 white beans into the other jar. Repeat steps 2 through Step 9 Complete the Activity Report. 
Predicting and  Explaining  Variations 	  By working on the problems of inheritance of coat color in Labrador retrievers, you have discovered some basic laws of genetics. These laws were discovered over 100 years ago by Gregor Mendel who did similar experiments on pea plants. Gregor Mendel was the founder of the formal science of genetics. In the 1860 s, working with common garden peas, he discovered the basic patterns of inheritance. Mendel was lucky that he decided to work with pea plants, because they have several traits that have only two variations or two alleles. Mendel studied stem length, which has two variationstall and short; pea pod color-green or yellow; pea seed color-green or yellow; and pea shape-round or wrinkled. Mendel worked with his pea plants for several years, making sure he had true-breeding varieties. True breeding varieties always produced offspring that were identical to themselves generation after generation. When Mendel mated tall pea plants with tall pea plants and planted those seeds, the plants from those seeds were all tall. When he mated short plants with short plants, the seeds from those plants produced all short plants. Then when he mated a tall plant with a short plant, those seeds all produced plants that were tall. Similarly, when he crossed plants that produced wrinkled seeds with ones that produced round seeds, all of the offspring plants produced round seeds. When he crossed yellow pod plants with green pod plants, all of the offspring had green pods. For each trait Mendel studied, the trait that always showed up (was expressed) among offspring of two different pure breeding plants he called the dominant trait. The trait that did not show up he called the recessive trait. Mendel did not use the words gene or allele, but he was able to predict what would happen, and explain what happened when he mated the peas in his garden. He observed that a pair of factors controlled each of the traits he was studying. Factor was the word he used. Today we use the words gene and allele. When a plant had one dominant factor and one recessive factor, the dominant factor was the one that was expressed (observed) in the offspring. Did You Know? As geneticists learn more about traits and variations and the genes and alleles that cause them, no one is surprised that there are genes for different traits on the same chromosome. Genes close together on the same chromosome and inherited together are called linked genes. The study of linked genes is one of the most exciting things that geneticists concerned with traits and variations in humans are studying today. By studying linkage, geneticists figure out which genes are on which chromosomes, and how close they are to each other on the chromosome. Using these techniques and others, geneticists are making maps of the chromosomes. These maps show where different genes are located. Gregor Mendel had another important contribution to the study of genetics. He determined that the factors must somehow separate and recombine when the pea plants produced seeds that would become new plants. He knew this because sometimes when plants showing a dominant trait were crossed, some of their offspring showed the recessive trait. This was just like your experiment in crossing the F1 puppies. When Mendel crossed a tall and a short pea plant and got all tall plants that did not mean the short trait was lost. The short trait was just hidden. Mendel had never seen a chromosome and did not know about meiosis. He did conclude, however, that pairs of factors separate and recombine during the crossing of two plants. What Mendel figured out using the peas in his garden is truly amazing. His discoveries form the foundation for modern genetics. CHAPTER 6 Single Gene Disorders Student Edition (Human Biology) 
Chapter  Outline 	  What are some genetic conditions that research might be able to help treat or cure? One reason that geneticists are interested in human traits and variations is because some are recognized as diseases, disorders, or defects. Geneticists, working to control, cure, or prevent these genetic conditions, hope to improve the quality of life. There are thousands of human genetic conditions caused by single genes. In these conditions, for some reason, the gene does not produce a protein that functions properly. To study these single gene conditions more easily, geneticists have classified them into three groups-dominant, recessive, and sex-linked-based on their pattern of inheritance. 
Dominant  Inheritance  Pattern 	  In those conditions that have the dominant inheritance pattern, the allele that causes the defect is a dominant allele. In this case, one of the parents has the condition and has the dominant allele. If only one parent has the condition, the children in that family will each have either a 50% or a 100% chance of inheriting it depending on the genotype of the affected parent. If the afflicted parent is heterozygous, the children have a 50% chance of receiving the dominant allele and a 50% chance of receiving the recessive allele. Heterozygous means that the person has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. If the parent is homozygous, all the children will receive the dominant allele. Homozygous means the person has the same alleles. In this case, the parent has two dominant alleles. A homozygous parent for the dominant allele can be represented by DD and a homozygous parent for the recessive allele can be represented by dd. A heterozygous parent can be represented by Dd. Remember that an uppercase letter always stands for the dominant allele and a lowercase letter always stands for the recessive allele. Now use D for the dominant allele and d for the recessive allele to sort alleles according to the possible genotypes of parents. Then you can find out what possible genotypes the different combinations of alleles might produce in their offspring. There are 1,500 confirmed or suspected dominant abnormal conditions in humans. The names of some of them are achondroplasia, which is a form of dwarfism, polydactyly, which means having extra fingers or toes, and Huntingtons disease, which causes progressive dementia later in life. Recently, the gene for Huntingtons disease has been found. A group of researchers in the early 1990s was able to identify the area of the specific chromosome (Chromosome 4) where the gene for Huntingtons disease is located by studying a population of affected people in Central America. Huntingtons disease is progressive, involving the destruction of brain cells. Usually, death occurs 10 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms. One of the characteristics of Huntingtons disease is that affected people usually do not get sick until after they are in their mid-30s. In the future, it may be possible for people to know they will develop the symptoms of a disorder before they actually get the disease, as researchers have been able to do for those with Huntingtons disease. 
Recessive  Inheritance  Pattern 	  Another class of inherited abnormal conditions is recessive conditions. In these conditions, both parents have a single recessive allele for the disorder. Because each of the parents has one recessive allele and one dominant allele, the condition is not apparent in them. It is hidden. Neither parent has the disease, but both are carriers of the disease. There is one chance in four that both parents will pass on the recessive allele to their child resulting in the child having both recessive alleles. The recessive allele will then be expressed and the child will have the disease. If the child received the recessive allele from only one parent, the child would be like the parents, that is, he or she would be a carrier but have no symptoms of the disease. The child could pass the allele on to his or her children. There is a common mistake that people often make about recessive conditions. Sometimes people mistakenly think that if parents have had one child with a condition, the next child will not have the condition. This conclusion is incorrect. Since each birth is a new event, the chances of having a child with the condition is one in four each time a child is conceived by these parents. There are over 1,220 confirmed or suspected recessive, abnormal conditions. Some of the common recessive conditions are cystic fibrosis, which affects the mucus and sweat glands, phenylketonuria, which is a deficiency of an enzyme in the liver,  sickle-cell disease, which is a disorder of the red blood cells, and Tay-Sachs disease, in which the brain is damaged. Because geneticists are learning much more about recessive disorders, you may read about them in the newspaper or hear about them on television. If you are a good observer, you may see something about a genetic disease almost every day. Have you read anything recently in the newspaper or in a magazine about genetic diseases and some possible new treatments or cures? 
Introduction 	  How can a single gene be responsible for causing a genetic condition in humans? What are some examples of single gene disorders? What kinds of treatments are available? In this activity you use models to demonstrate how dominant and recessive alleles interact with each other to cause genetic disorders. Then you select an example of a single gene disorder to investigate. 
Activity  Report 	  Computer with Internet connection (Optional) 
Procedure 	  Step 1 Obtain 2 strips of colored construction paper and 2 strips of clear plastic. Place the strips on the table in front of you. Imagine that each strip of paper and plastic is an allele (gene) for the same trait. The colored strips of paper represent dominant alleles and the clear plastic strips represent recessive alleles. Step 2 Place a colored strip on top of another colored strip. What do you observe? These alleles contain the same information. The variation represented by this information will be expressed in the individual. Dominant alleles and the clear plastic strips represent recessive alleles. Step 3 Place a colored strip on top of a clear strip of plastic. What do you observe? These alleles contain different information from one another. The variation caused by the dominant allele will be expressed in the individual. Step 4 Place a clear plastic strip on top of the colored strip. What do you observe? These alleles contain different information from one another. Which variation will be expressed in the individual? Step 5 Place one clear plastic strip on top of the other clear plastic strip. What do you observe? In this pair of alleles, the variation caused by the recessive alleles is expressed. Step 6 Return the strips. Step 7 Select one of the following single-gene disorders or another one of your choice to investigate. Use the library, local college or university resources, and the Internet, if available, to research the selected single-gene disorder. 
Polydactyly 	  What is known about the disorder you selected? On which chromosome is the defective gene located? Are there treatments for this disorder, and, if so, what are they? What do geneticists need to find out in order to treat or cure the disorder? Step 8 Complete the Activity Report. 
X-linked  Inheritance  Pattern 	  For some traits, there is a difference in the variations that are expressed (seen) among males and females. For example, many more boys than girls are color-blind. Some of these traits are called X-linked or sex linked. The genes for these traits are part of the X chromosome but are not on the Y chromosome. This is because the X chromosome is larger and possesses more genes. 
The  Transmission of  X-linked  Traits 	  The gene for an X-linked genetic disease is controlled by two alleles. If the expression of the recessive allele results in the genetic disease, then we represent this recessive allele by the lowercase letter n. The normal condition results when the normal allele is present because it is dominant. We represent this allele by the uppercase letter N. The symbols n and N, indicating the X-linked trait are shown on the X chromosome but not the Y chromosome. TABLE 8.1:

CK-12 Pedigree Analysis Animation CHAPTER 7 Other Genetic Conditions and Genetic Counselings Student Edition (Human Biology) 
Chapter  Outline 	  How do chromosomes and the environment contribute to human variation? In addition to the genetic conditions caused by a single gene, there are other genetic conditions caused by the interaction of several genes that are considered diseases, disorders, or defects. Some genetic conditions resulting in physical abnormalities are caused, not by a single gene, but by the interaction of several genes. Because several genes cause the condition, determining the chance of the condition being passed from a parent to a child is more complicated than for single gene defects. Some of the genetic conditions caused by the interaction of several genes include the following. Cleft lip, in which the person is born with a deformed upper lip Club foot, a condition in which the foot is turned in 
Chromosomal  Disorders 	  Some genetic conditions are caused not by a single gene or the interaction of several genes, but by a chromosomal error. Sometimes chromosomes break during meiosis and a person is born with a piece of chromosome missing. Sometimes, during meiosis, the chromosomes do not separate properly, and a person is born with 47 chromosomes, instead of 46. The best known example of this kind of chromosomal condition is Down syndrome. People with Down syndrome have 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of only 2 copies. They usually have an extra fold of skin near the eye, a large tongue, and small hands with short fingers. In addition, they may have defects of the heart, eyes, and ears. They also tend to have learning disabilities of various degrees of severity. Just as there is great diversity among people without Down syndrome, there also is great diversity among people who have Down syndrome. Some individuals with Down syndrome can function in society with reasonable independence, while others require a good deal of help and guidance. Did You Know? Today you are a different person than you were yesterday. Millions of cells in your body are dividing right now as you read, and mutations or errors are a natural part of DNA replication. Most of these errors have no adverse effect on you. Most of these DNA errors are repaired by our DNA repair enzymes. Some of these errors are harmless even if they are not repaired, but some can be deadly! Some DNA mutations can cause cancer, a condition of uncontrolled cell growth. 
Genetic  Disease and  Environmental  Factors 	  There are a number of common diseases that can be caused by both the environment and the genes you are born with. Cancer and heart disease are two good examples. If you have a parent who had cancer, you are predisposed (more likely) to get cancer yourself. However, these conditions are so closely linked to environmental influences that it is often hard to tell the real cause. For example, suppose a parent dies from lung cancer (abnormal cell growth in the lungs) and smoked most of his or her life. It is hard to determine if that person developed lung cancer because his or her lungs were particularly sensitive to smoking, or if he or she would have developed lung cancer anyway as a result of heredity. Why do some people get lung cancer from smoking, while others do not? If a parent has a disease, it is important for you to learn about the nature of that disease and the risk factors that might make it more likely that you, too, will get the disease. Risk factors are the activities and lifestyles you choose that make it more or less likely for an outcome to occur. For example, if you choose to be an emergency room physician, you will work in a stressful profession. You may be more likely to develop stress-related problems such as high blood pressure. If your family has a history of heart disease and stroke, a stressful profession might be a risk factor you should minimize. Maybe it would be better for you to become a dermatologist or a pediatrician. Other risk factors for heart disease are smoking, lack of exercise, and a high-fat diet. Everyone should minimize such risk factors. However, it is especially important for those individuals who have a genetic predisposition for developing heart disease to do so. 
Genetic  Counseling 	  How do you know if you have a gene that puts you at risk for a disease? Genetic counseling is a profession that is mostly concerned with helping people who may have genetic-related conditions. It is estimated that 20% of all people have a genetic condition, have someone in their immediate family (mother, father, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, or cousin) with a genetic condition, or carry the allele for a defect that may be passed onto their children. Genetic counseling is performed by a team of genetic specialists. This team might include the genetic counselor, a physician, the cytotechnologist (who makes the karyotype), laboratory technicians, and a molecular geneticist who is concerned about the structure and function of DNA. The genetic counselor is the person who coordinates the team and talks directly to the patients. People see a genetic counselor for one of two reasons. Either they have given birth to a child with a genetic condition or they think they are at risk of giving birth to a child with a genetic condition, because of a family history of the disorder. Families who have given birth to a child with a genetic condition usually ask three questions. Why has this happened to us? What can we do about it? Will it happen again? People who think they are at risk for giving birth to a child with a genetic condition want to know what that risk is. In both cases, the genetic counselor helps the family learn more about the condition. The first thing that a genetic counselor does when working with a family is gather all the information about the traits and variations of the family members to construct a pedigree chart. The genetic counselor will schedule meetings with the geneticist, physicians, and laboratory technicians for the family. The genetic counselor will help the family learn what is known about the condition. The genetic counselor may put the family in contact with other people who have the same genetic condition, so they can provide help and support for one another. There may be a genetic counselor in your community who will come to your class and talk about his or her work. 
Population  Genetics 	  In studying genetics, we have considered some of the problems about how traits and variations are passed from parents to children so that there is both continuity and diversity within a species. The first people to study genetics were concerned about the relationship between allele pairs and variations. Molecular geneticists are concerned with problems involving the structure and function of DNA and how it directs the production of proteins in a cell. Genetic counselors are concerned about the health care of families with genetic conditions. One group of geneticists that we have not discussed are called population geneticists. Population geneticists are concerned, not about a single family, but about how and why some alleles are found in people in certain parts of the world and not others. They wonder, for example, why many people in Central Asia have Type B blood, but very few American Indians have this blood type. By studying the genes in a population, population geneticists form a link to those scientists who study evolution. Population geneticists are trying to learn more about how living organisms, including humans, change over time. 
Introduction 	  The Human Genome Project is an international effort to map and sequence all the estimated 80,000 to 100,000 genes in human DNA and to determine and analyze the sequence of the 3 billion (3,000,000,000) chemical bases that make up human DNA. The implications and applications of information gained through this project have already affected human lives. In the next section you will learn more about the Human Genome Project. This activity helps you obtain information about human genes and genetic disorders from the Human Genome Project. 
Procedure 	  Step 1 Select a number from 1 to 23. This number represents the chromosome you will investigate. Step 2 Contribute to a class letter to the Human Genome Project Center requesting information about your selected chromosome. In the class letter, request information such as the size of the chromosome, the names and locations on the selected chromosome of the genes identified to date, and what characteristics the identified genes control. Step 3 When your Human Genome Project information arrives, select one of the genes on your chromosome and investigate the trait (genetic expression) of the gene. If the gene you select has a known disorder, focus your research and presentation on the diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment of the condition. Step 4 Prepare a presentation to your class about the gene you selected. Your presentation might take the form of a poster presentation, computer presentation, story, or a presentation format of your own choice.

Chapter  Outline 	  How can learning about DNA solve new problems? Once scientists recognized the importance of DNA and how DNA controlled the production of proteins, they began to use this knowledge to solve new problems. One problem that scientists had to solve was how to get DNA to make protein in the laboratory. For example, the pancreas of a person who has diabetes may not make insulin. Insulin is a protein that helps the body regulate the use of sugar. Until the 1980s, a person with diabetes had to take artificial insulin that was extracted from the body of a pig. But there were problems associated with using nonhuman insulin. Now human insulin can be made in a laboratory. The production of human insulin resulted from genetic engineering. The process of getting genes to produce their proteins in the laboratory is called genetic engineering. Genetic engineering uses the quick reproducing capabilities of certain types of cells, such as bacterial cells, to make lots of copies of certain proteins, such as insulin. To do this, the genetic engineer must put the DNA gene for the protein to be produced into the bacteria in such a way that the bacteria will duplicate it. The new genetic material in the bacteria is called recombinant DNA (or rDNA). Bacteria are important workhorses for genetic engineering because scientists can put foreign, recombinant DNA into them. Even though bacteria are simple cells, their own genetic material is very complex. It would be very difficult to put recombinant DNA into the bacterial chromosome. But bacteria can have little circles of DNA outside of their chromosome that replicate like the chromosome replicates. These circles of DNA are called plasmids. Molecular biologists have figured out how to put (or splice) DNA from other organisms into bacterial plasmids. Then the bacteria replicate these plasmids with the inserted genes. In this way, it is possible to use bacteria to make many, many copies of a gene. Making copies of a gene in this way is called cloning. Scientists use special containers that have all the nutrients these bacterial cells need to grow and reproduce as quickly as possible. After the bacterial cells grow and divide many times and produce all of the proteins coded by the plasmid DNA, the scientists open the cells and remove the proteins needed, such as insulin. The illustration below summarizes how bacteria can be used to make human insulin. In spite of all these difficulties, recombinant DNA technology is a rapidly growing area of genetics called molecular genetics. Scientists have reproduced or are close to being able to reproduce the DNA coding for many proteins including the following. 
Insulin, the protein that controls diabetes 	  Interferon, a protein that is used in cancer therapy and to prevent and/or cure certain viral diseases such as rabies, hepatitis, and herpes 
An enzyme that breaks up protein 	  Cloned anti-viral vaccines are being tested. Scientists are also using recombinant DNA technology to improve food crops. Imagine a tomato plant that makes a protein that kills the bugs that eat it but is safe for humans. The potential for recombinant DNA technology is unlimited. 
Human  Genome  Project 	  The Human Genome Project is addressing one of the most monumental problems that scientists are working onhow to locate all of the human genes in the 23 pairs of chromosomes. To solve such a huge problem, geneticists, biologists, chemists, engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, and many others from all over the world joined together in 1989 to create the Human Genome Project. Genome is a word meaning all the DNA-genes of a species. The process of determining the location of a gene on a chromosome is called gene mapping. The current estimate is that humans have about 20,000 to 24,000 genes. It also is estimated that there are over 3 billion pairs of nucleotides that make up human DNA. Some people might ask, Why would scientists want to be able to locate all of the human genes? One answer is that scientists, as human beings, are curious about nature. They are always asking why, and they want to know more. Another reason to locate all of the human genes is to improve health. There are thousands of genetic conditions that result in an illness or a handicap that are caused by single gene defects. Although some of these conditions have symptoms that can be treated, we have no way to treat the diseases themselves, let alone to cure the people who have the disease. Those working on the Human Genome Project hope that its research will enable us to learn more about genetic diseases and help lead to cures. In addition, those working on the Project believe that the research will provide tools for learning more about the causes of other human diseases including cancer, schizophrenia, and Alzheimers disease. The scientists working on the Human Genome Project expect that the entire human genome will be sequenced early in the 21st century. Already the entire genome of some organisms that are simpler than humans have been sequenced. The technology that made it possible to locate, isolate, splice, and clone the gene for insulin is the same technology that is being used in the Human Genome Project. Exactly 6,218 genes were mapped as of April 19, 1998. Most of the known genes that have been mapped are genes that cause diseases, such as sickle-cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. There is still much work to be done on mapping human genes. But the most important work still remains-figuring out what all of the estimated 20,000 to 24,000 human genes do and how they do it. Also, questions about the variations in human genes need to be addressed. After all, whose genomes are being sequenced by the Human Genome Project? How do they differ from yours? One important fact about human genes that has been learned is that a gene is not contained in a single continuous location on a chromosome. Rather, a gene seems to have three types of nucleotide sequences. Figure 9.3 shows the three types of nucleotide sequences. Some scientists are calling the nucleotides that dont seem to code for anything junk DNA. But scientists are learning so much about DNA, we may someday learn that the junk DNA is doing something, may be even something important. While the current genetic technology has helped scientists learn quite a lot about human DNA, genes, and chromosomes, it is slow, expensive, and still subject to error. The Human Genome Project itself, however, is improving the quality and precision of genetic technology. Some people worry that the Human Genome Project will have harmful effects on human life. If we know where all the human genes are located, could parents order a human being with the variations they want, rather than allow the chromosomes with genes and alleles to sort at random (naturally)? Will knowing more about human genes and chromosomes increase tolerance for the great variety of humans or increase discrimination? As a result, one group of people in the Human Genome Project is studying the possible effects the project will have on people so we can avoid and solve potential problems. 
Summary 	  Genetics is the study of the biological causes of genetic continuity and diversity. To learn about continuity and diversity, geneticists study how traits and variations are inherited. Some geneticists study the inheritance of traits and variations at the cellular level. These geneticists are concerned with genes, alleles, and chromosomes. Other geneticists study traits and variations at the molecular level. These geneticists are concerned with the structure and function of DNA and with protein synthesis. Some geneticists are concerned with variations that cause people to be disabled. Other geneticists study inheritance among large groups of people rather than inheritance in individual families. As a result of their research, geneticists are able to tell us many things about the inheritance of traits and variations. The results of their research also lead to more and more unanswered questions. Genetics is an area of science that is changing very rapidly as we learn more about the human genome. Some geneticists are even studying the ethical and public policy implications of new discoveries in genetics.
